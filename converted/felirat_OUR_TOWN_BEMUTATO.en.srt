1
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:51,806
This play is called “Our Town.”

2
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,978
In it you will see Dr. Gibbs, Mrs. Gibbs, George Gibbs, Rebecca Gibbs,

3
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:22,322
Constable Warren, Howie Newsome, Joe Crowell, Si Crowell, Simon Stinson, Mrs. Soames.

4
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:32,494
The name of our town is Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire

5
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,581
just over the line from Massachusetts; latitude 42 degrees,

6
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,667
40 minutes, longitude 70 degrees, 37 minutes.

7
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:52,839
The first act shows a day in our town. The date is May 7, 1901, just before dawn.

8
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,011
Sky is showing some streaks of light over in the East there,

9
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,097
the mornin’ star gets brighter just before it has to go.

10
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:18,269
Well, now I’ll show you how our town lies. Here’s Main Street.

11
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:23,356
Over there on the left is the railroad tracks. The Congregational Church is over there;

12
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,442
the Presbyterian’s across the street.

13
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,528
Methodist and Unitarian are over there. Baptist is—by the river.

14
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:38,614
Across the tracks is— the Catholic Church,

15
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Next to the Post Office is the Town Hall; jail is in the basement.

16
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,786
Washington once made a speech from those steps.

17
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,958
This is the Main Street. Along Main Street there’s a row of stores.

18
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,044
Here are the poles that the horses are tied to.

19
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,131
First automobile’s goin’ to come along in about five years—

20
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,217
belonged to Banker Cartwright, our richest citizen.

21
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:19,303
Lives in the big white house on the hill.

22
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,475
Here’s the grocery store and Mr. Morgan’s drugstore.

23
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:34,561
Everyone in town goes to those stores.

24
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,733
This is Doctor Gibbs’ house.

25
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,819
This is the back door.

26
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:54,906
Here’s a couple of trellises for those who need scenery.

27
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:59,992
This is Mrs. Gibbs’ garden— Corn… chickpeas... beans... peas... heliotrop

28
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,078
and lots of weeds.

29
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:10,164
Back then we got newspapers twice a week—

30
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,250
the Grover’s Corners Sentinel— this is Editor Webb’s house .

31
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,336
And Mrs. Webb’s Garden. Just like Mrs. Gibbs’s :

32
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:25,422
Corn… chickpeas... beans... peas... but with sunflowers—

33
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:35,594
Right here ...

34
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:40,681
is a big walnut tree.

35
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,853
Nice town, right?

36
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,939
Nobody very remarkable ever come out of it.

37
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,025
The earliest dates on the tombstones in the cemetery

38
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:06,111
say 1670–1680. They’re Grovers and Cartwrights

39
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:11,197
and Gibbses and Herseys—- same names from here now.

40
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,283
Like I said: it’s early morning. The only lights on are in a cottage

41
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:21,369
over by the tracks where a Polish mother’s had twins.

42
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,542
And in the Joe Crowell house, where Joe Junior’s gettin’ ready

43
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:36,628
to deliver the paper.

44
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:41,714
And in the depot, where Shorty Hawkins is gettin’ ready

45
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
to flag the 5.45 train for Boston. Aya—there she is.

46
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,886
A ll around, they’ve been lights on for some time, what with milkin’ and so on.

47
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:56,972
But town folks sleep late. So—another day’s begun.

48
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:02,058
Here comes Doc tor Gibbs down the Main Street , returning from that baby case.

49
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:07,144
And here’s Mrs. Gibbs coming down to begin breakfast.

50
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,317
Doc tor Gibbs died in 1930. New hospital’s named after him.

51
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:22,403
Mrs. Gibbs died of pneumonia visiting her daughter Rebecca,

52
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,489
who married an insurance man in Canton, Ohio,

53
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,575
and died there of pneumonia, but her body was brought back here.

54
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,661
She’s buried in that cemetery—

55
00:08:39,747 --> 00:08:42,747
she was Julia Hersey before she married Dr. Gibbs

56
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,833
in the Congregational Church.

57
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,919
In our town we like to know the facts about everybody.

58
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:03,092
There’s Mrs. Webb starting breakfast too.

59
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,264
And here comes Joe Crowell deliverin' the paper.

60
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:23,436
– Good m ornin g , D r. Gobbs! – Good m ornin g , Joe!

61
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:28,522
– Want your paper now? – Yes, I’ll take it.

62
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:38,694
Anybody been sick?

63
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,781
No. Some twins born in Polish Town —

64
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,867
I see your teacher Miss Foster is getting married.

65
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,953
Yes, sir, to a man in Concord.

66
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,039
Well, how do you boys feel about that?

67
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,125
Well, it’s not my business— but I think

68
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,211
if a person starts out to be a teacher she should stay one.

69
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:14,297
How’s your knee, Joe?

70
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,383
Fine, Doc tor . Only like you said, it tells me

71
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,469
when it’s going to rain.

72
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:29,556
– Is it telling you rain today? – No.

73
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,642
– Sure? – Yes , sir.

74
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:39,728
– Knee ever make a mistake? – No sir.

75
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:44,814
I want to tell you something about that boy. Joe was smart—

76
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
graduated top of his class.

77
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,986
He got a scholarship to Boston Tech—M.I.T.

78
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:00,072
Graduated top of his class from there too.

79
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:05,158
It was in all the Boston papers at the time.

80
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:10,244
Joe was going to be an engineering, but the war started

81
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:15,331
and he died in France.

82
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,417
All that education for nothing. What business he had fighting the Germans

83
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:25,503
we don’t know now, but it seemed perfectly clear at the time.

84
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,675
Here comes Howie Newsome delivering milk.

85
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:40,761
Giddy up, Bessie. What’s the matter with you?

86
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,933
– Bună dimineața , Doc tor ! – Bună dimineața , Howie!

87
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,019
– Somebody sick? – Pair of twins over to Mrs. Goruslawski’s.

88
00:11:58,106 --> 00:12:01,106
Twins, eh? This town’s gettin’ bigger every year.

89
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:06,192
Going to rain, Howie?

90
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,278
No. Fine day, with sunshine, no joke. Come on, Bessie.

91
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:16,364
Hello, Bessie! How old is she?

92
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,450
Almost seventeen. Bessie’s been confused since the Lockharts

93
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,536
cancelled their milk delivery. She wants to head that way

94
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,622
and yells at me the whole time.

95
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:41,794
– Good morning, Mis’ Gibbs. – Good morning, Howie!

96
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:46,881
Doc tor ’s comin’ down the street.

97
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,967
Is he? Seems like you’re late today.

98
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:57,053
Aya. Something went wrong with the cart this morning. I don’t know what happened.

99
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,225
Children, time to get up!

100
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,311
Come on, Bessie!

101
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:22,483
Everything ok, Frank?

102
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,569
Yes. Easy as kittens.

103
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,656
Bacon will be ready soon. Come drink your coffee.

104
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,828
Can you get some more sleep this morning?

105
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:47,914
Mrs. Wentworth’s cornin’ at eleven with a stomach issue.

106
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I know what’s her problem. Her stomach is not the same as it was.

107
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:58,086
You won’t get more than three hours sleep. Frank Gibbs, I don't know

108
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,172
what’s goin’ to become of you. I  wish you could rest more.

109
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:08,258
It would do you good.

110
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,344
Emily! Wake up! Wally! Seven o’clock!

111
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,431
You’ve got to speak to George. Somethin’s come over him lately. He’s no help.

112
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,603
I can’t even get him to cut me wood.

113
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:33,689
Is he sassy to you?

114
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,775
No, just whines! All he thinks about is baseball—

115
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:48,947
George! Rebecca! You’ll be late for school.

116
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:54,033
George! George, look sharp!

117
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:59,119
– Yes, Pa! – Don’t you hear your mother?

118
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:04,206
Walleee! Wash yourself good or I’ll do it myself.

119
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,292
I’m going to lie down.

120
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,378
Wash yourself good or I’ll do it myself.

121
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:19,464
Ma! What dress shall I wear?

122
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,550
Be quiet ! Your father’s been out all night and needs his sleep.

123
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,636
I washed and ironed your blue dress.

124
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,722
– Oh, Ma, I hate that dress. – Oh, hush.

125
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:39,808
Every day I go to school dressed like— like a sick turkey.

126
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,894
Y ou always look lovely.

127
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:49,981
Mama, George’s throwin’ soap at me!

128
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:55,067
I'll be right up to slap you both .

129
00:15:57,153 --> 00:16:00,153
We got a factory in our town, too. Hear it?

130
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,239
Makes blankets. Cartwrights own it, made  a fortune.

131
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,411
Children! Now slow down.

132
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,583
Breakfast is just as important as lunch or dinner. I won’t have you gobblin’ like wolves.

133
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:30,669
You will not grow, if you eat like that... That ’s for sure. Wally, put away your book!

134
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,755
Oh, Ma! By ten o’clock I got to know about Canada.

135
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,842
You know the rules — no books at table.

136
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,928
I’d rather have my children healthy than bright.

137
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,014
I’m both, Mama, you know I am.

138
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I’m the brightest girl in school my age. I have a very good memory.

139
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,186
Eat your breakfast.

140
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:11,358
I’ll speak to your father. Twenty-five cents a week’s enough

141
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:16,444
for a boy of your age.

142
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,530
I don’t know how you spend it all.

143
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,617
Aw, Ma,—I gotta lotta things to buy.

144
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:31,703
Strawberry phosphates— that’s what you spend it on.

145
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,789
I don’t see why Rebecca gets much money. She has more  than a dollar.

146
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,875
I’ve been saving up.

147
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,961
Well, I think it’s good to spend some every now an’ then.

148
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,047
Mama, you know what I love most in the world? Money.

149
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:57,133
Eat your breakfast.

150
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:02,219
There's the bell. I gotta go.

151
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:07,305
Don’t run. Wally, pull up your pants.

152
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,392
Rebecca, t ell Miss Foster I send her my best. Can you remember that?

153
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:17,478
Yes, Ma.

154
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,650
You look nice, Rebecca. Pick up your feet!

155
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,822
Here, here— No, you go away,— Here— What's the matter with you?

156
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:42,908
All you do is fight— You don’t belong to me. Where'd you come from?

157
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Good morning, Myrtle. How’s your cold?

158
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,167
Well, I still have a tickle in my throat. Told Charles I didn’t know

159
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:03,253
if I’d go to choir rehearsal tonight.

160
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,339
Have you tried singing at a higher pitch ?

161
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,425
Yes, but I can’t stay on key. While I’m restin' I thought

162
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:18,511
I’d string some beans.

163
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:23,597
Let me help. Beans have been good this year.

164
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:28,683
Aya, I want to have forty quarts if it kills me. Children say they hate ’em

165
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,769
but they’ll eat them all winter.

166
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:38,855
Look, Myrtle, I have to tell you something. If I don’t tell somebody I’ll burst.

167
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,942
Why Julia Gibbs!

168
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:49,028
Tell me, Myrtle, is one of those

169
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:54,114
second-hand furniture men come to see you?

170
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
No !

171
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,286
Well, he visited me. First I thought he was

172
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,372
one of Doctor Gibbs’ patients. He came inside

173
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,458
and offered me 350 dollars for Grandmother Wentworth's highboy.

174
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:19,544
Why, Julia Gibbs!

175
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,630
Yes, yes. On that old thing. It was so big I didn’t know where to put it.

176
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,717
I almost give it to my cousin, Hester Wilcox

177
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:34,803
– Well, you’re going to take it, aren’t you? – I don't know.

178
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,889
You don’t know!—three hundred and fifty dollars? What’s come over you?

179
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,975
If I could get my husband to use the money for a trip,

180
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:50,061
I’d sell it like that.

181
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:55,147
You know, Myrtil, I’ve always wanted to see Paris, France.

182
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:00,233
I’ve been promising myself for years that if we ever had the chance-—

183
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,319
How’s Doctor feel about it?

184
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:10,405
Well, I said if I got an inheritance—

185
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:15,492
that’s the way I put it— I’d make him take me.

186
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:20,578
M-m-m— What did he say?

187
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,664
You know how he is. I haven’t heard a serious word out of him, since I’ve known him.

188
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,750
No, he said, it might make him discontented

189
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,836
with Grover’s Corners to go to Europe;

190
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,922
Every two years he makes a trip to the battlefields of the Civil War

191
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:46,008
and that’s enough he says.

192
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:51,094
Well, Mr. Webb just admires the way Doctor Gibbs knows everything about the Civil War.

193
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Mr. Webb’s ready to give up Napoleon and move over to the Civil War – hopeless – ,

194
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,267
only Doctor Gibbs being one of the greatest experts in the country makes him despair.

195
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:06,353
It’s a fact, my husband is never so happy as when he’s at Gettysburg.

196
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,439
The times I’ve walked over those hills, Myrtle, stopping at every bush,

197
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,525
like we was going to buy it.

198
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:26,697
Well, if that second-hand man’s serious Julia, you sell it.

199
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:31,783
And then you’ll get to see Paris.

200
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,869
Just keep droppin’ hints —

201
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:41,955
that’s how I got to see the Atlantic Ocean.

202
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:47,042
Oh, I’m sorry I mentioned it. Only it seems to me that once in your life,

203
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:52,128
you ought to see a country where they don’t talk in English

204
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:57,214
and don’t even want to.

205
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Thank you very much, ladies.

206
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,386
Thank you. Now we’ll skip a few hours.

207
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,472
But first we want a little more information about our town— a scientific account.

208
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,558
So I’ve asked Professor Willard of our State University to discuss

209
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,644
our past history here. Professor Willard?

210
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:32,817
May I introduce Professor Willard ...

211
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,989
Just a few brief notes, — unfortunately our time is limited.

212
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:48,075
Grover’s Corners—mmm— let me see— Grover's Corners lies

213
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,161
on the old pleiocene granite of the Appalachian range .

214
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:58,247
on some of the oldest land in the world—

215
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,333
we’re proud of that. Of course there are more recent outcroppings,—sandstone showing

216
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,419
through a shelf of Devonian basalt, and some vestiges of Mezozoic shale,

217
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:13,505
but these are comparatively new— perhaps two or three hundred million years.

218
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:23,678
Some interesting fossils have been found—

219
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,764
two miles north of the Peckham Farm— in Silas Peckham’s cow-pasture.

220
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,850
These may be seen in the museum at the University at any reasonable time.

221
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,936
Shall I read some of Professor Gruber’s notes

222
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:44,022
on the meteorological situation— mean precipitation, et cetera?

223
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:49,108
Afraid we won’t have time for that, Professor.

224
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:54,194
We might have a few words on the history of man here.

225
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,280
– Oh, anthropological data— – Er—yes.

226
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,367
Early Amerindian stock, Cotahatchee tribes—

227
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:09,453
no evidence before the 10th Century —

228
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,539
now entirely disappeared— Oh, possible traces in three families—

229
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,625
migration in early part of the 17th Century

230
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:24,711
of English brachiocephalic blue-eyed stock—

231
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:29,797
Since then, some Slav and Mediterranean—

232
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:34,883
And the population?

233
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,969
– Within the town limits: 2,640. – The twins are born , p rofessor.

234
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:45,055
Oh yes. The population at the moment is 2,642.

235
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:50,142
The Postal District brings in 507 more—

236
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:55,228
making a total of 3,149.

237
00:25:57,314 --> 00:26:00,314
Mortality, birth rates—constant. By McPherson’s gauge: 6.032.

238
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Thank you very much, Professor Willard.

239
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:10,486
We are all truly obliged to you.

240
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,572
– When were the twins born? – Today, a t dawn.

241
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:20,658
Now the political and social report: Editor Webb .

242
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,830
Oh, Mr. Webb?

243
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:41,003
He’ll be here soon— He just cut his hand eatin’ an apple.

244
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:46,089
Thank you, Mrs. Webb.

245
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:51,175
Mr. Webb is Publisher and Editor of The Grover’s Corners Sentinel, our local paper.

246
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:01,347
Charles, ever ybody’s waiting for you!

247
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:06,433
Well, we’re run by a Board of Selectmen.

248
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,519
All males vote at the age of 21.

249
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:16,605
Women vote indirect.

250
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:21,692
We’re lower middle-class: sprinklin’ of professional men—

251
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:26,778
and 10% illiterate laborers: unskilled, illiterate workers.

252
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,864
Politically, 86% Republicans;

253
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,950
6% Democrats; 4% Socialists; Rest, indifferent.

254
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:42,036
Religiously, 85% Protestants; 12% Catholics;

255
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,122
Rest, indifferent.

256
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,208
Have you any comments, Mr. Webb?

257
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:57,294
What do you think of our little town, Grovers Corner’s, Mr Webb?

258
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,380
Well, if you ask me, I can tell you that it ’s a very ordinary town.

259
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:07,467
Little better behaved than most.

260
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,553
Probably a lot duller. But our young people here seem to like it well enough .

261
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,639
90% of ’em settle down right here to live—

262
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:22,725
even when they’ve-been away to college.

263
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:27,811
We have a few questions from the audience. Row 3, seat 4.

264
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:32,897
Is there much drinking in Grover’s Corners?

265
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,983
Well, ma’am, I wouldn’t know what you’d call much.

266
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:43,069
Saturday nights the farmhands meet down in Ellery Greenough’s stable.

267
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:48,155
We’ve got one or two town drunks. But they always repent whenever

268
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,242
a travelling preacher comes to town.

269
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:58,328
No, I’d say liquor ain’t a regular thing in the home here,

270
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:03,414
except as medicine for a cold. Or snake-bite, y ou know.

271
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
This has always been like that.

272
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:13,586
The next question is about social issues and social injustice.

273
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,672
Why doesn't anyone do something about it?

274
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,758
Everybody is,—somethin’ terrible. Seems like they spend

275
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,844
most of their time talking about who’s rich and who’s poor.

276
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,930
Well, I dunno. I guess we’re huntin’

277
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:39,017
for a way the diligent and sensible can rise to the top

278
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:44,103
and the lazy and quarrelsome sink to the bottom.

279
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:49,189
But it ain’t easy to find.

280
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:54,275
Meantime, we take care of those who can’t help themselves

281
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,361
and those that can we leave alone. Any other questions?

282
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:04,447
We have time for one more question. 4th r ow, seat 3.

283
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:09,533
I s there any culture or love of beauty in—Grover’s Corners?

284
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,619
Well, ma’am, there ain't much—not in the sense you mean. There’s some girls

285
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:19,705
that play the piano over at High School Commencement; but they ain’t happy about it.

286
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,791
There isn’t much culture; but we like the sun cornin’ up

287
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:29,878
over the mountain in the morning, and we all notice a good deal about the birds.

288
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,964
And we watch the change of the seasons:

289
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,050
yes, everybody knows about them. But those other things—

290
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:45,136
there ain’t much—Robinson Crusoe and the Bible;

291
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,222
and Händel’s Largo, we all know that; and Whistler’s Mother—

292
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,308
those are about as far as we go.

293
00:30:57,394 --> 00:31:00,394
Now we’ll go back to town.

294
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,480
It's two o’clock.

295
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,566
All 2642 souls has had their lunches, and all the dishes have been washed.

296
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:15,653
The children have gone back to school.

297
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,825
Doc tor Gibbs is in his office, makin’ ’em say “Ah”.

298
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,911
Mr. Webb’s cuttin’ his lawn —

299
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,997
one man in ten thinks it’s a privilege to push his own lawn-mower.

300
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:46,169
I can’t, Lois. I’ve got to go help my mother.

301
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:51,255
I promised her.

302
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:56,341
Emily, walk simply. Who do you think you are today?

303
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,428
Oh, Papa, one minute you tell me to stand up straight

304
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:06,514
and the next minute you call me names. I don’t listen to you.

305
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I've never had such a kiss .

306
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:16,686
Excuse me, Mrs. Forrest.

307
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:21,772
You go play in the fields, young man. You got no business playing baseball on Main Street.

308
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,858
Sorry, Mrs. Forrest…

309
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,944
Hello, Emily!

310
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,030
H el lo .

311
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:42,116
You made a fine speech in class.

312
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:47,203
Well—I was ready to make a speech about the Monroe Doctrine,

313
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,289
but at the last minute Miss Corcoran made me

314
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,375
talk about the Louisiana Purchase.

315
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:02,461
I worked hard on both of them.

316
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:07,547
Gee, it’s funny, Emily. From my window I can see your head

317
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,633
nights when you’re doing your home-work in your room.

318
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:17,719
Why, can you?

319
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:22,805
You stick to it, Emily. I don’t see how you can sit still that long.

320
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:27,891
I guess you must like school.

321
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:32,978
Well, I always feel it’s something you have to go through.

322
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:38,064
Yeah.

323
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,150
I don’t mind it. Time passes faster in school .

324
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:48,236
Yeah.

325
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,408
Emily, what do you think? We might work out a kinda telegraph

326
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:03,494
from your window to mine;

327
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,580
once in a while you could give me hint about one of those Algebra problems.

328
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,666
I don’t mean the answers, Emily, just some little hint—

329
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,753
Oh I think hints are allowed. So…

330
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,839
If you get stuck, you whistle and I’ll give you some hints.

331
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:34,011
Emily, you’re naturally bright .

332
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:39,097
I figure it’s just the way a person’s bom.

333
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:44,183
Yeah. But I want to be a farmer. My Uncle Luke says

334
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:49,269
whenever I’m ready I can come work on his farm

335
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,355
and if I’m any good I can gradually have it.

336
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:59,441
You mean the house and everything?

337
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:04,528
Yeah. Well—I better get to the baseball field.

338
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:09,614
Thanks for the talk, Emily.— Good-afternoon, Mrs. Webb.

339
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,700
– Good-afternoon, George! – So-long, Emily!

340
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:19,786
So long, George!

341
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:35,044
Emily, come help me string these beans.

342
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,130
George Gibbs let himself have a real conversation, didn’t he?

343
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:45,216
Why, he's growing up. How old is he?

344
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:50,303
Oh, I don’t know.

345
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:55,389
Let’s see. He must be like sixteen. No more than sevnteen.

346
00:35:57,475 --> 00:36:00,475
Mama, I made a speech in class today and I was very good.

347
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,561
You must recite it to your father at supper. What was it about ?

348
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:10,647
The Louisiana Purchase. It was like silk off a spool.

349
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,733
I’m going to make speeches all my life. — Mama, are these big enough ?

350
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:20,819
Try a little bigger.

351
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,905
Mama, can I ask you something , but serious?

352
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,991
Seriously, dear—not serious.

353
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:36,078
– Seriously… will you? – Of course.

354
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,250
Mama, am I pretty ?

355
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:51,336
Yes, of course. Both my children got good features. I’d be ashamed if they hadn’t.

356
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:56,422
Oh, Mama, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is: am I beautiful ?

357
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,508
I’ve already told you, yes. You have a nice young pretty face.

358
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:06,594
Now that's enough.

359
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Oh, Mama, you never tell us the truth about anything.

360
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:16,766
I am telling you the truth.

361
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,939
Mama, were you beautiful ?

362
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:32,025
Yes, I was . I f one can say such a thing about oneself.

363
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:37,111
I was the most beautiful girl in town next to Mamie Cartwright.

364
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:42,197
But Mama, you’ve got to say something about me.

365
00:37:44,283 --> 00:37:47,283
Am I pretty enough to get people interested in me ?

366
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:52,369
Emily, you make me tired!

367
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:57,455
You’re pretty enough for all normal purposes.

368
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:02,541
Come along and bring that bowl with you.

369
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:07,628
Oh, Mama, you’re no help.

370
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Now, I think this is a good time to tell you

371
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:22,886
that the Cartwrights have begun building a new bank in Grover's Corners—

372
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,972
had to go to Vermont for the marble.

373
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:38,144
And they've asked a friend of mine what they should put in the cornerstone

374
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,230
for people to dig up a thousand years from now.

375
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:48,316
'Course, they’ve put in a copy of the New York Times

376
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:53,403
and a copy of Mr. Webb’s Sentinel,

377
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:58,489
Some scientific fellas have found a way of painting

378
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,575
all that reading matter with a kind of glue—- silicate glue—

379
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:08,661
that'll make it keep a thousand— two thousand years—

380
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:13,747
We’ d put in a Bible — a copy of the Constitution of the United States

381
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,833
and a copy of William Shakespeare’s plays.

382
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:29,005
What you you think?

383
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:34,091
Y’ know, Babylon once had two million people in it,

384
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:39,178
and all we know about them is the names of the kings and some copies

385
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:44,264
of wheat contracts and— the sales of slaves.

386
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,350
Yes, every night all those families sat down to supper,

387
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:54,436
and the father came home from work, and the smoke went up the chimney, same as here.

388
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:59,522
So I’m going to have a copy of this play

389
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,608
put in the cornerstone so people a thousand years from now’ll know

390
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,694
about us— more than the Treaty of Versailles

391
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,780
and the Lindbergh flight. you know what I mean?

392
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:19,866
Well then, people living a thousand years from now :

393
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,953
This is the way we were, in our growing up and in our marrying,

394
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,039
and in our living, and in our dying.

395
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:40,211
Now we’ll get back to Grover's Corners. It’s evening.

396
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:45,297
You can hear the choir practice in the Congregational Church.

397
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:55,469
The children are doing their homework.

398
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:05,641
The day is runnin’ down like a tired clock.

399
00:41:12,814 --> 00:41:15,814
All right , let ’s start from the beginning.. .

400
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,900
Remember, ladies, music came into the world to give pleasure...

401
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:31,072
Let’s try it again!

402
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:41,244
Bles sed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love

403
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,330
the fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above.

404
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:56,503
Softer! Softer!

405
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:01,589
Get it out of your head that music’s only good when it’s loud.

406
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:06,675
You leave loudness to the Methodists.

407
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:11,761
You can't beat them at that, even if you wanted to.

408
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,933
Now again, tenors!

409
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:32,105
Blessed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love ...

410
00:42:39,278 --> 00:42:42,278
– Emily! – Hello!

411
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:47,364
I can’t work. The moonlight’s terrible.

412
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:57,536
– Emily, did you get the third problem? – Which?

413
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:02,622
The third.

414
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,708
Why, yes, George— that’s the easiest one.

415
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:12,794
I don’t see it. Can you give me a hint?

416
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I’ll tell you one thing: the answer’s in yards.

417
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,966
– In yards? How do you mean? – In square yards.

418
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:28,053
– Oh—in square yards. – Yes, don’t you see?

419
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:33,139
– Yeah. – In square yards of wallpaper.

420
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:38,225
Oh, I see. Square yards of wall-paper! Thanks a lot, Emily.

421
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:43,311
You're welcome , George . My, isn’t the moonlight terrible? And choir practice. ..

422
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:48,397
If you hold your breath, you can hear the train all the way to Contookuck!

423
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,569
Hear it?

424
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,741
M-m-m— What do you know!

425
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:18,914
Well, I guess I better try to learn .

426
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
– Goodnight, Emily. – Goodnight, George.

427
00:44:26,086 --> 00:44:29,086
That’s better. But not good.

428
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:34,172
Before I forget:

429
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:39,258
How many of you can sing at Fred Hersey’s wedding on Tuesday?

430
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:44,344
Put your hands up.

431
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,430
We'll play sing what we sang three weeks ago at the wedding of Jane Trowbridge.

432
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:59,602
"Art thou weary, art thou languid?" It’s a question. Make it talk.

433
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:04,689
– Oh, George, can you come down ? – Yes, Pa.

434
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,775
And remember Sunday to take the second verse real soft at the end.

435
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,947
Ready?

436
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,119
Make yourself comfortable. I’ll only keep you a minute. George, how old are you?

437
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:35,205
Me? I'm sixteen, almost seventeen.

438
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,291
What do you want to do after school’s over?

439
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:45,377
I want to be a farmer on Uncle Luke’s farm.

440
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:50,464
You’ll be willing to get up early and milk and feed the stock—

441
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,550
and you’ll hoe and hay all day ?

442
00:45:57,636 --> 00:46:00,636
Sure, I will. What do you mean, Pa?

443
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,808
Well, George, while I was in my office today

444
00:46:12,894 --> 00:46:15,894
I heard a funny sound:

445
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,980
a nd what do you think , what was it?

446
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,152
Your mother chopping wood.

447
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,239
There you see your mother— up early;

448
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:41,325
cooking meals all day; washing and ironing;—

449
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:46,411
and still she has to chop wood,

450
00:46:48,497 --> 00:46:51,497
I guess she got tired of asking you.

451
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:56,583
She decided it was easier to do it herself.

452
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:01,669
And you eat her meals, and put on the clothes she washes,

453
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:06,755
and you run off and play baseball,—

454
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:11,841
like she’s some hired girl we don’t really love, but we keep around the house .

455
00:47:19,014 --> 00:47:22,014
Well, I wanted to let you know. Here's a handkerchief, son.

456
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,100
I’ve decided to raise your spending money , George.

457
00:47:29,186 --> 00:47:32,186
25 cents a week.

458
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:37,272
Not for chopping wood, because that’s a present you give your mother,

459
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,358
but because you’re getting older—

460
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,444
I imagine there are things you need it for now.

461
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,530
Thanks, Pa.

462
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,616
Let’s see— tomorrow’s pay day.

463
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:02,702
Probably Rebecca’ll feel she ought to have some more too.

464
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:07,789
Wonder what could have happened to your mother.

465
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,875
Choir practice never was as late as this before.

466
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:17,961
It's only half-past eight, Pa.

467
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:23,047
I don’t know why she's in that choir anyway. She sounds like an old crow!

468
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:28,133
And traipsin’ around at this hour of the night! About time you retired, don’t you think?

469
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:33,219
Yes, Pa.

470
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:43,391
– Goodnight, Martha. – Goodnight, Mr. Foster.

471
00:48:45,477 --> 00:48:48,477
I’ll tell Mr. Webb; I know he’ll want to put it in the paper.

472
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,650
My, it’s late!

473
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:03,736
Goodnight, Irma.

474
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:13,908
– Real nice choir practice, wasn’t it? – Um-m!

475
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Myrtle Webb! Look at that moon!

476
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:34,252
Good potato-growing weather is coming, that’s for sure!

477
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:39,339
Well, I didn't want to say it in front of those others but now we’re alone—,

478
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:44,425
it’s the worst scandal ever in this town!

479
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:49,511
– What? – Simon Stimson!

480
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:54,597
Now, Louella!

481
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:59,683
But, Julia! The organist of a church, drunk year after year.

482
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:04,769
You saw he was drunk tonight.

483
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:09,855
You know he was drunk tonight.

484
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:14,941
Louella! We all know about Mr. Stimson, and we all know about his troubles,

485
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:20,027
and Doctor Ferguson knows too. A nd if Reverend Ferguson keeps him, it means

486
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:25,114
th e only thing the rest of us can do is just not to notice it.

487
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:35,286
Not to notice it! But it’s getting worse.

488
00:50:37,372 --> 00:50:40,372
No, it isn’t, Louella.

489
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,458
I’ve been in that choir twice as long as you. It doesn’t happen anywhere near so often.

490
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,544
Louella, look at that beautiful moon!

491
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,630
Those children will be up all night. Goodnight, Louella.

492
00:50:57,716 --> 00:51:00,716
Goodnight, Myrtle. Can you get home safe, Louella?

493
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:10,889
Oh, it’s bright as day. I can see my husband scowling at the windows now.

494
00:51:12,975 --> 00:51:15,975
You’d think we’d been to a dance the way the men folk carry on. Goodnight, Julia.

495
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:21,061
Goodnight, Louella.

496
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:31,233
– See you on Sunday. – See you then !

497
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:41,405
Well, we had a real good time.

498
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,491
You’re late enough.

499
00:51:48,577 --> 00:51:51,577
Why, Frank, it ain’t any later than usual.

500
00:51:53,664 --> 00:51:56,664
And you stopping to gossip with a lot of hens.

501
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,750
Don’t be grouchy.

502
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:06,836
Come smell my heliotrope in the moonlight.

503
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:11,922
Isn’t that wonderful? What did you do tonight?

504
00:52:14,008 --> 00:52:17,008
Oh, I read—What were the girls gossiping about tonight?

505
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,094
– Well, there’s something to gossip about. – Simon Stimson far gone, was he?

506
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,180
Worst I've seen him. How’ll that end, Frank?

507
00:52:29,266 --> 00:52:32,266
Reverend Ferguson can’t forgive him forever.

508
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,352
I guess I know more about Simon Stimson’s affairs than anybody in this town.

509
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:42,439
Some people ain’t made for small town life.

510
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:47,525
I don’t know how that’ll end; but there’s nothing we can do — Get in.

511
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:52,611
No, not yet. —Frank, I'm worried about you.

512
00:52:54,697 --> 00:52:57,697
What are you worried about ?

513
00:52:59,783 --> 00:53:02,783
I think you need a real rest

514
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:07,869
and change.

515
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:12,955
If I get that inheritance. I’m going to insist on it.

516
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:18,041
Now, Julia, not that again.

517
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:23,127
Frank, you’re unreasonable!

518
00:53:25,214 --> 00:53:28,214
Come on, Julia, it’s late. You’ll catch cold—

519
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,300
I gave George a piece of my mind tonight. I’m sure that from now on

520
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:38,386
You'll have your wood chopped, for a while anyway. No, no.

521
00:53:40,472 --> 00:53:43,472
Oh dear, there’s always so many things to pick up.

522
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:48,558
You know, Frank, Mrs. Grover always locks her front door.

523
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,644
All those people that part of town do.

524
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,730
They’re all gettin’ citified. They haven't got anythin’ fit to steal..

525
00:54:05,902 --> 00:54:08,902
Get out, Rebecca. There’s only room for one here.

526
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:19,075
Well, let me look just a minute.

527
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:24,161
Use your own window.

528
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:29,247
There's no moon there ...

529
00:54:36,419 --> 00:54:39,419
George, do you know what I think?

530
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:44,505
I think maybe the moon’s getting nearer and nearer

531
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,591
and there’ll be a big explosio n!

532
00:54:51,677 --> 00:54:54,677
You have no idea, Rebecca . If the moon were getting nearer,

533
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:59,764
the men that sit up all night with telescopes would see it

534
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,850
and it’d be in all the newspapers.

535
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,936
George, is the moon shining on South America, Canada

536
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:15,022
and half the whole world?

537
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:20,108
Well—probably is.

538
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Nine-thirty.

539
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:35,366
Most lights in town are out.

540
00:55:37,452 --> 00:55:40,452
There's Constable Warren trying a few doors on Main Street.

541
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,539
Here comes Editor Webb, after putting his newspaper to bed.

542
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:50,625
– Good evening. Bill. – Evenin’, Mr. Webb.

543
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:55,711
– Quite a moon! – Yeh!

544
00:55:57,797 --> 00:56:00,797
All quiet tonight?

545
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:05,883
Simon Stimson is rollin’ around a little. Just saw his wife out

546
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,969
looking for him so I looked the other way— there he is now.

547
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,141
Good evening, Simon !

548
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:26,227
Town seems to have settled down for the night.

549
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:31,314
Yes, most of the people in town have gone home, Simon.

550
00:56:38,486 --> 00:56:41,486
I guess we better do the same.

551
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:51,658
Can I walk along with you?

552
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,744
Good night.

553
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:06,916
I don’t know how that’s goin’ to end, Mr. Webb.

554
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:12,002
Well, he's been trouble ...

555
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:17,089
Oh, Bill , if you see my boy smoking,

556
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:22,175
give him a word? He thinks a lot of you.

557
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:27,261
I don’t think he smokes, Mr.Webb, not more than two or three cigarettes a year.

558
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:37,433
Hm. I hope not. Good night, Bill.

559
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,519
Good night, Mr. Webb.

560
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:52,691
– Who’s that? Is that you Myrtle? – No, it’s me, Papa.

561
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:57,777
Why aren’t you in bed?

562
00:57:59,864 --> 00:58:02,864
I don’t know. I can’t sleep, Papa. The moonlight’s wonderful.

563
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,950
And Mrs. Gibbs’s heliotropes. Can you smell it?

564
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:13,036
Hm—Yes. No troubles on your mind, Emily?

565
00:58:15,122 --> 00:58:18,122
Troubles, Papa. No !

566
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:23,208
Well, don’t let your mother catch you. Good night, Emily.

567
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:28,294
Good night , Papa.

568
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:38,466
I never told you about that letter Jane Crofut got from her minister

569
00:58:40,552 --> 00:58:43,552
when she was sick.

570
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:48,638
The address on the envelope said:

571
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:53,725
Jane Crofut; The Crofut Farm, Grover’s Corners; Sutton County;

572
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:58,811
New Hampshire; United States of America.

573
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:03,897
What’s funny about that?

574
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:08,983
Listen, it’s not finished: the United States of America; Continent of North America;

575
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:14,069
Western Hemisphere; the Earth; the Solar System;

576
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:19,155
the Mind of God.

577
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:24,241
What do you know!

578
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:29,327
– Yep, and the postman delivered it. – What do you know!

579
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,500
That’s the end of the First Act.

580
00:59:46,672 --> 00:59:49,672
T hree years have gone by.

581
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:59,844
Yes, the sun has risen a thousan d times.

582
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,930
Summers and winters have cracked the mountains more and the rains

583
01:00:07,016 --> 01:00:10,016
brought down some of the dirt.

584
01:00:12,102 --> 01:00:15,102
Some babies that weren’t even born before, have begun talkin’ sentences;

585
01:00:17,188 --> 01:00:20,188
and a number of people who thought they were young have noticed

586
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:25,275
that they can’t bound up a flight of stairs like they used to.

587
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:30,361
All that can happen in a thousand days.

588
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:35,447
Nature’s been pushin’ in other ways, too—

589
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,533
a number of young people fell in love.

590
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:45,619
The First Act was called The Daily Life ; this Act is called Love and Marriage .

591
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:55,791
Almost everybody in the world gets married— know what I mean?

592
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:05,963
In our town there aren’t many exceptions.

593
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:11,050
Most everybody climbs into their grave married.

594
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:21,222
So; three years later. 1904. July 7th,

595
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:26,308
just after High School Commencement.

596
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:31,394
That’s when our young people jump up and get married.

597
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Soon as they’ve passed their last examinations, looks like they feel themselves fit to get married

598
01:01:38,566 --> 01:01:41,566
and Cicero's words, it would seem that they consider themselves marriageable.

599
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,738
It’s early morning. Only this time it’s been raining.

600
01:01:53,825 --> 01:01:56,825
It was absolutely pouring down with thunderstorms.

601
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,911
Mrs. Gibbs’s garden— and Mrs. Webb’s here—drenched.

602
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:06,997
A lot of bean stems and pea pods are full of water.

603
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,083
All yesterday, over on Main Street the rain looked like curtains being blown along.

604
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:17,169
Hear it? Hm—don't know now— may begin again any minute.

605
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:22,255
There’s the 5 0.45 train for Boston.

606
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,341
And there’s Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb

607
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:32,427
making breakfast, as if this were an ordinary day.

608
01:02:34,513 --> 01:02:37,513
I don’t have to point out to the women in the audience

609
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,600
that both these ladies cooked three meals a day,

610
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:47,686
one of ’em for twenty years and the other for forty—

611
01:02:49,772 --> 01:02:52,772
no summer vacation.

612
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:57,858
They raised two children apiece, washed, cleaned the house,

613
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:02,944
and never had a nervous breakdown.

614
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:08,030
Never thought themselves hard-used, either — It’s like what one of those poets said:

615
01:03:10,116 --> 01:03:13,116
‘’You got to love life to have life, and you got to have life to love life—’’

616
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:18,202
Do you know who said that?

617
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:23,288
Thornton Wilder, the author of this play. As the saying goes – it’s a vicious circle.

618
01:03:30,461 --> 01:03:33,461
There comes Howie Newsome and Bessie, deliverin’ the milk.

619
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:38,547
Giddy up, Bessie!

620
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:43,633
And there’s Si Crowell deliverin’ the papers like his brother.

621
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:48,719
Good morning, Howie .

622
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:53,805
Good morning, Si. Anythin’ in the papers I ought to know.

623
01:03:55,891 --> 01:03:58,891
Nothin’ much, we’re losin’ about the best baseball pitcher

624
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:03,977
– George Gibbs – Grover’s Corners ever had.

625
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:09,063
Aya, reckon he is.

626
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:14,150
Now all he’ll be doin’ is pitchin’ hay.

627
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:19,236
Whoa, Bessie! Guess I can stop and talk.

628
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:29,408
– George could hit, too. And run bases. – Fine ballplayer.

629
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:34,494
I don’t see how he could give that up  to get married.

630
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,580
Would you, Howie?

631
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,666
Can’t tell. Si. Never had that talent.

632
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:49,752
Mornin’, Howie!

633
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,838
Good morning , Bill. You’re up early.

634
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:59,925
Seein’ if there’s anything I can do to prevent a flood.

635
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:10,097
River’s been risin’ all night.

636
01:05:12,183 --> 01:05:15,183
Si Crowell here’s upset George Gibbs is retiring from baseball.

637
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:20,269
That’s how it goes. In '84 we had a player, far better than George Gibbs. .

638
01:05:22,355 --> 01:05:25,355
His name was Hank Todd.

639
01:05:27,441 --> 01:05:30,441
Hank Todd! In '84 we had a player whose name was that.

640
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:35,527
He went to Maine and become a parson.

641
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:40,613
Wonderful ballplayer.

642
01:05:47,786 --> 01:05:50,786
Howie, how's the weather?

643
01:05:52,872 --> 01:05:55,872
Not bad. Think maybe it’ll clear up for good.

644
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:11,130
– Goo morning, Mrs. Gibbs. – Good morning, Howie.

645
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:16,216
Too bad about the weather. It’s been raining so heavy that maybe it’ll clear up.

646
01:06:18,302 --> 01:06:21,302
– Certainly hope it will. – How much did you want today?

647
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:26,388
Looks like I’ll need three-a-milk and two-a-cream.

648
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:31,475
Three a milk and two a cream.

649
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:41,647
My wife says to tell you, mrs. Gibbs,

650
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,733
we hope they’ll be happy. And I’m sure they will.

651
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:51,819
Thanks, Howie. Tell your wife I hope she gets to the wedding.

652
01:06:53,905 --> 01:06:56,905
She will if she can .

653
01:07:04,077 --> 01:07:07,077
Good morning, M rs. Webb.

654
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:12,163
Oh, good morning, Mr. Newsome. I told you four quarts,

655
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,250
but I hope you can spare another.

656
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:22,336
Yes , madam… and two-a-cream.

657
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:32,508
Will it start raining again, Howie?

658
01:07:34,594 --> 01:07:37,594
Well— I was just telling Mrs. Gibbs it may clear up.

659
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,680
My wife told me to tell you as how we hope

660
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:47,766
they’ll be happy, M’s Webb,—know they will.

661
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:52,852
Thank you, and thank Mrs. Newsome , we’re counting on seeing you at the church.

662
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,938
Yes, Mrs Webb. We hope to be there Come on, Bessie!

663
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:08,111
Well, Ma. You’re losing one of your chicks.

664
01:08:10,197 --> 01:08:13,197
Yes.

665
01:08:15,283 --> 01:08:18,283
Frank Gibbs, don’t you say another word.

666
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:23,369
Sit down and drink your coffee.

667
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:33,541
The groom’s shaving, only there ain’t much to shave—

668
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:38,627
whistling like he's glad to leave us.—

669
01:08:40,713 --> 01:08:43,713
Every now and then he says “I do” to the mirror, but it don't sound convincing to me.

670
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Really, Frank, I don’t know how he’ll get along. I’ve arranged his clothes,

671
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:53,886
kept his feet and warm things on—

672
01:08:55,972 --> 01:08:58,972
Frank, they’re too young! Emily won’t think of such things.

673
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:04,058
He’ll catch his death-a-cold within a week.

674
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:09,144
I remember my wedding morning.

675
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,230
Now don't start, Frank.

676
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:19,316
I was the searedest young fella in New Hampshire.

677
01:09:21,402 --> 01:09:24,402
I thought I'd made a mistake.

678
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:29,488
When I saw you coming down that aisle

679
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:34,575
I thought you were the prettiest girl I’d seen;

680
01:09:36,661 --> 01:09:39,661
the only trouble was that I’d never seen you before.

681
01:09:41,747 --> 01:09:44,747
I was in the Congregational Church marryin’ a total stranger!

682
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:54,919
And how do you think I felt? Frank, w eddings are awful things.

683
01:09:57,005 --> 01:10:00,005
Farces! Here, I made you something.

684
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:05,091
Why, Julia! French toast!

685
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:10,177
I had to do something.

686
01:10:12,263 --> 01:10:15,263
– How’d you sleep, Julia? – Well, I heard the clock every hour.

687
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:20,350
Yes!

688
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:25,436
Aya, I get a shock every time I think of George

689
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:30,522
setting out to be a family man!

690
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,608
There’s nothing so terrifying in the world as a son.

691
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:40,694
The relation of father and son is the damndest, —

692
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,780
Well, mother and daughter’s no picnic—

693
01:10:47,866 --> 01:10:50,866
They’ll have troubles, but that’s none of our business.

694
01:10:52,952 --> 01:10:55,952
Everybody has a right to their own troubles.

695
01:10:58,038 --> 01:11:01,038
Aya… people are meant to live two-by-two in this world. It’s not good to be all by yourself.

696
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,125
Julia, do you know one of the things I was scared of when I married you?

697
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:11,211
I was afraid we didn’t have enough to talk about for more than  a few weeks.

698
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:16,297
that we’d eat our meals in silence.

699
01:11:18,383 --> 01:11:21,383
Well, you and I been conversing for twenty years without

700
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:26,469
any barren spells.

701
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:31,555
Well, good weather, bad weather, I always find something to say.

702
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:36,641
Did you hear Rebecca up yet?

703
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,727
No. Only day of the year Rebecca hasn’t been managing everybody’s business.

704
01:11:43,813 --> 01:11:46,813
She’s hiding, might be crying.

705
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Lord’s sakes— this has got to stop.

706
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:56,986
Rebecca! Come get breakfast.

707
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:02,072
Good morning. Only four more hours to live!

708
01:12:09,244 --> 01:12:12,244
– Where are you going? – To see my bride .

709
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,330
Now, George, put on your boots . It’s raining torrents.

710
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:22,416
You don’t go out of this house without being prepared.

711
01:12:24,502 --> 01:12:27,502
Aw, Ma—it’s just a step.

712
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:32,588
You’ll catch your death-a-cold through the service.

713
01:12:34,674 --> 01:12:37,674
George, do what your mother says!

714
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:42,761
From tomorrow on you can go wherever and whenever you want,

715
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:47,847
While you’re in my house you’ll live wisely .

716
01:12:55,019 --> 01:12:58,019
Perhaps Mrs. Webb isn’t used to callers this early.

717
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:08,191
Here, take a cup of coffee.

718
01:13:15,363 --> 01:13:18,363
Just a sec.

719
01:13:25,536 --> 01:13:28,536
Good morning, Mother Webb.

720
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,708
Oh my God! You frightened me! B ut you know I can’t ask you in.

721
01:13:40,794 --> 01:13:43,794
Why not—?

722
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,880
Why, George, the groom can’t see

723
01:13:50,966 --> 01:13:53,966
his bride on his wedding day.

724
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:59,052
Aw,—that’s  superstition. Good morning, Mr. Webb.

725
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:04,138
Good morning, George.

726
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:09,224
Mr. Webb, you don’t believe in that, do you?

727
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:14,311
There’s common-sense in superstitions, George.

728
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:24,483
Millions have followed it, George,

729
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:29,569
and don’t be the first to fly in the face of custom.

730
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:39,741
How is Emily?

731
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:44,827
She hasn't waked up yet.

732
01:14:46,913 --> 01:14:49,913
Emily’s asleep?

733
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:54,999
No wonder! We were up all night sewing and packing.

734
01:14:57,086 --> 01:15:00,086
Now, George; you sit with Mr. Webb and drink this cup of coffee;

735
01:15:02,172 --> 01:15:05,172
I’ll run upstairs and make sure Emily doesn’t come downstairs.

736
01:15:07,258 --> 01:15:10,258
There's bacon, too. But don’t stay long.

737
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,430
Well, George, how are you?

738
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:25,516
I'm fine. Mr. Webb, what commonsense could there be in a superstition like that?

739
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:30,602
Well, on the wedding morning a girl’s head's full of clothes and—

740
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:35,688
one thing and another.

741
01:15:37,774 --> 01:15:40,774
That’s probably it?

742
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:45,861
I never thought of that.

743
01:15:47,947 --> 01:15:50,947
A girl's nervous on her wedding day.

744
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:56,033
Gee, I wish a person could get married without all that marching.

745
01:15:58,119 --> 01:16:01,119
Every man that’s ever lived has felt that way, George, but it was no use.

746
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:06,205
It’s the women who’ve built up weddings.

747
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:11,291
For a while now the women have it all their own.

748
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:16,377
A man looks pretty small at a wedding, George.

749
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:21,463
All those women making sure the knot’s tied

750
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:26,549
in a public way.

751
01:16:28,636 --> 01:16:31,636
Well, you believe in it, don’t you, Mr. Webb?

752
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,722
Yes. Oh, yes! Now, don’t get me wrong, boy,

753
01:16:38,808 --> 01:16:41,808
marriage is a wonderful thing. Don’t forget that, George.

754
01:16:43,894 --> 01:16:46,894
No, sir. Mr. Webb, how old were you when you got married?

755
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,980
Well, I'd been to college and taken a little time to get settled.

756
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:57,066
But my wife wasn’t much older than Emily.

757
01:16:59,152 --> 01:17:02,152
Oh, age hasn’t got much to do with it, George, compared with—

758
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,238
other things.

759
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,324
What were you going to say, Mr. Webb?

760
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:17,411
Ah, I don’t know… Was I going to say something?

761
01:17:19,497 --> 01:17:22,497
I was remembering the other night what my father said

762
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:27,583
when I got married.

763
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:32,669
Charles, he said: start right off showin ’ who’s boss.

764
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:37,755
Best thing to do is to give an order, just so she’ll learn to obey,

765
01:17:39,841 --> 01:17:42,841
Then he said: “If anything about her irritates you,

766
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,927
the tone of her voice, or something else, get right up and leave the house;

767
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:53,013
that’ll make it clear to her.” And he said: "Never let your wife know

768
01:17:55,099 --> 01:17:58,099
how much money you have, never.”

769
01:18:00,186 --> 01:18:03,186
Well…

770
01:18:05,272 --> 01:18:08,272
So I took the opposite of his advice

771
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:13,358
and I’ve been happy ever since. So let that be a lesson to you , George ,

772
01:18:15,444 --> 01:18:18,444
never to ask advice on personal matters ...

773
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:23,530
... are you going to raise chickens?

774
01:18:25,616 --> 01:18:28,616
– What? – Are you raising chickens on your farm?

775
01:18:30,702 --> 01:18:33,702
A book came in on the Philo System of raising chickens.

776
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:38,788
I wish you’d read it. I’m thinking of beginning myself,

777
01:18:40,874 --> 01:18:43,874
in the back yard! I’m going to put an incubator in the cellar—

778
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:48,961
Charles Webb, are you talking about that incubator again?

779
01:18:51,047 --> 01:18:54,047
I thought you were talking about serious things.

780
01:18:56,133 --> 01:18:59,133
Well, Myrtle, if you want to give the boy some advice,

781
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:04,219
I’ll go upstairs and leave you alone with him.

782
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:09,305
George, Emily’s got to eat breakfast!

783
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:14,391
She sends you her love, but doesn’t want to see you. Goodbye, George.

784
01:19:16,477 --> 01:19:19,477
Myrtle, guess you didn’t know about that older superstition.

785
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:24,563
Since the caveman. No bridegroom should see

786
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:29,649
his father-in-law the day of the wedding.

787
01:19:31,736 --> 01:19:34,736
Or a day close to it. Remember that.

788
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:39,822
I have to interrupt again. You see, we want to know how all this began.

789
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:44,908
The wedding… the plan for two people to spend their whole lives together.

790
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:49,994
I'm terribly interested in how big things like this start.

791
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,080
You know how it is: you’re 21 or 22 and you make some decisions;

792
01:19:57,166 --> 01:20:00,166
then whisssh– you’re 70; you’ve been a lawyer for 50 years,

793
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:05,252
and that white-haired lady by your side

794
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:10,338
has eaten over fifty thousand meals with you.

795
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:15,424
How do such things begin?

796
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:25,597
George and Emily will show you the conversation they had

797
01:20:27,683 --> 01:20:30,683
when they first knew

798
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:35,769
”they were meant for one another”.

799
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:40,855
Before they do I want you to remember

800
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:45,941
when you were very young,

801
01:20:48,027 --> 01:20:51,027
the days when you were first in love;

802
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:56,113
when you were like a person sleep-walking.

803
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:01,199
You didn’t hear a thing they said to you.

804
01:21:03,286 --> 01:21:06,286
You’re a little bit crazy. Will you remember that, please?

805
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:11,372
It ’s three o’clock. Now they’ll be coming out of High School .

806
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:16,458
George has just been elected President of the Senior Class ; since it's June,

807
01:21:18,544 --> 01:21:21,544
that means he will be the senior class president next year.

808
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:31,716
And Emily’s just been elected Secretary and Treasurer.

809
01:21:38,888 --> 01:21:41,888
Aya, they’re coming down Main Street now.

810
01:21:43,974 --> 01:21:46,974
I can't, Louise, I gotta go home.

811
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:52,061
Goodbye. Oh, Ernestine!

812
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:57,147
Can you come over tonight and do Latin ?—

813
01:21:59,233 --> 01:22:02,233
Isn’t Cicero the worst thing?— Well, tell your mother you have to.

814
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:12,405
Bye , Helen, bye, Fred.

815
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:17,491
Emily, can I carry your books home?

816
01:22:19,577 --> 01:22:22,577
Why—uh—thank you. It isn’t far.

817
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:27,663
’Scuse me, Emily, will you?— Say, Bob, if I’m a little late,

818
01:22:29,749 --> 01:22:32,749
start practice, and give Herb some long high ones.

819
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:37,836
Bye , Lizzie.

820
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:42,922
Hello , Lizzy .

821
01:22:50,094 --> 01:22:53,094
I’m glad you were elected too, Emily.

822
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,180
Thank you.

823
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:03,266
– Emily, why are you mad at me? – I’m not mad at you.

824
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:08,352
You’ve been treating me so funny lately.

825
01:23:10,438 --> 01:23:13,438
Well, since you ask, I might as well say it , George—

826
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:18,524
Oh, goodbye. Miss Corcoran.

827
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:23,611
Goodbye, Miss Corcoran.—

828
01:23:30,783 --> 01:23:33,783
What is it?

829
01:23:35,869 --> 01:23:38,869
I don’t like the whole change that’s come over you in the last year.

830
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:43,955
Change?

831
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:49,041
I’m sorry if that hurts your feelings but I have to tell you the truth.

832
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:59,213
Wha-what do you mean?

833
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:04,299
Well, up to a year ago, I used to like you a lot. I used to watch you —

834
01:24:06,386 --> 01:24:09,386
because we’d been friends so long.

835
01:24:11,472 --> 01:24:14,472
And then you began spending all your time at baseball.

836
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:19,558
And you never stopped to speak to anybody anymore not even to your own family, you didn’t.

837
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:24,644
George, ever since you’ve been elected Captain, you’ve got stuck up

838
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,730
and conceited. All the girls say so.

839
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:34,816
And it hurts to hear 'em say it;

840
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:39,902
but I agree with ’em because it's true.

841
01:24:41,988 --> 01:24:44,988
Gosh, Emily. I guess it’s hard for a fella not to have

842
01:24:47,074 --> 01:24:50,074
some faults creep into his character.

843
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:55,161
I always expect a man to be perfect. He has to be like that.

844
01:24:57,247 --> 01:25:00,247
Oh, I—I don’t think it’s possible to be perfect, Emily.

845
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:05,333
Well, my father is. And as far as I can see, your father is.

846
01:25:07,419 --> 01:25:10,419
No excuse why you shouldn’t be, too.

847
01:25:12,505 --> 01:25:15,505
Well, I feel it’s the other way round;

848
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:20,591
men aren’t naturally good, but girls are.

849
01:25:22,677 --> 01:25:25,677
Well, I’m not perfect.— It’s not as easy for a girl to be perfect

850
01:25:27,763 --> 01:25:30,763
as a man, because we girls are more … nervous ...

851
01:25:37,936 --> 01:25:40,936
Now I’m sorry I said all that about you, George. .

852
01:25:43,022 --> 01:25:46,022
I don't know what made me say it.

853
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:56,194
Now I can see it’s not the truth.

854
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,280
It’s not important, anyway.

855
01:26:08,452 --> 01:26:11,452
Emily—would you like an ice-cream soda before you go home?

856
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,624
Well, thank you , I would.

857
01:26:28,797 --> 01:26:31,797
Hello, Stew, how are you? Good afternoon, Mrs. Slocum.

858
01:26:33,883 --> 01:26:36,883
Hello, George. Hello Emily. What’ll you have?—

859
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:41,969
Why, Emily Webb, what you been cry in’ about?

860
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:47,055
She got an awful scare, Mr. Morgan.

861
01:26:49,141 --> 01:26:52,141
That—that hardware-store wagon almost ran over her.

862
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:57,227
Tom Huckins drives like a crazy man.

863
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:02,313
D rink some water, Emily. You look very distracted.

864
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:12,485
You got to look both ways before you cross Main Street these days.

865
01:27:14,572 --> 01:27:17,572
Gets worse every year— What’ll you have?

866
01:27:19,658 --> 01:27:22,658
I’ll have a lemonade , thank you, Mr. Morgan !

867
01:27:24,744 --> 01:27:27,744
No, no, Emily—have an ice-cream with me.

868
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:32,830
Two strawberry and chocolate ice-cream, Mr. Morgan.

869
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,916
Two strawberry and chocolate ice-cream , yes sir.

870
01:27:40,002 --> 01:27:43,002
There are 1 25 horses in Grover’s Corners this minute I’m talking to you.

871
01:27:45,088 --> 01:27:48,088
State Inspector was here yesterday.

872
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:53,174
And now they’re bringing in these auto-mo-biles,

873
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,260
best thing to do is just stay home.

874
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:03,347
Why I can remember when dogs used to sleep

875
01:28:05,433 --> 01:28:08,433
in the middle of the street, and nothing ever come to disturb them.

876
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:13,519
There you are! Mrs. Ellis, be with you in a minute.

877
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:23,691
They’re so expensive.

878
01:28:25,777 --> 01:28:28,777
No, no—don’t think of that, Emily. We’re celebrating—our election—

879
01:28:30,863 --> 01:28:33,863
And then do you know what else I'm celebrating?

880
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:38,949
I’m celebrating because I've got a friend who tells me what ought to be told me.

881
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:44,035
George, don’t think of that.

882
01:28:46,122 --> 01:28:49,122
I don't know why I said it. It’s not true. You’re—

883
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:54,208
No, Emily, I’m glad you spoke to me like you did.

884
01:28:56,294 --> 01:28:59,294
But I’m going to change so quick. You can count on that.

885
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,466
And Emily, I want to ask you a favor.

886
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:14,552
W-wh-a-t?

887
01:29:16,638 --> 01:29:19,638
I f I go away to State Agriculture College next year,

888
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:24,724
will you write me a letter once in a while?

889
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,810
I certainly will, George—

890
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:39,983
It seems like being away three years

891
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:45,069
you’d get out of touch with things.

892
01:29:47,155 --> 01:29:50,155
Maybe Grover’s Corners won’t be so interesting after a while.

893
01:29:57,327 --> 01:30:00,327
Grover’s Corners isn’t a very important place when you think of—

894
01:30:02,413 --> 01:30:05,413
all New Hampshire; but I think it’s a very nice town.

895
01:30:07,499 --> 01:30:10,499
The day wouldn’t come when I wouldn’t want to know

896
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:15,585
everything about our town. I know this is true, Emily.

897
01:30:17,672 --> 01:30:20,672
Well, I’ll try to make the letters interesting.

898
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:30,844
Emily, whenever I meet a farmer I ask him if he thinks

899
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:35,930
it's important to go to Agriculture School to be a good farmer.

900
01:30:48,188 --> 01:30:51,188
Yeh, and some of them say it’s even a waste of time.

901
01:30:53,274 --> 01:30:56,274
You can get all that stuff, anyway,

902
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,360
in the pamphlets the Government sends out— Uncle Luke’s gettin’ old,—

903
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:06,447
he’s about ready for me to take over his farm.

904
01:31:08,533 --> 01:31:11,533
My!

905
01:31:13,619 --> 01:31:16,619
And like you say, being gone all that time—

906
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:21,705
in other places and meeting other people— I guess new people

907
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:26,791
probably aren’t any better than old ones.

908
01:31:28,877 --> 01:31:31,877
I feel that you’re as good a friend as I’ve got.

909
01:31:33,963 --> 01:31:36,963
I don’t need to go and meet new ones.

910
01:31:39,049 --> 01:31:42,049
But George, maybe it’s important for you

911
01:31:44,135 --> 01:31:47,135
to go and learn all that cattle-judging and soils and those things.

912
01:31:49,222 --> 01:31:52,222
Of course, I don’t know.

913
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:57,308
Emily I’m going to make up my mind right now—I won’t go. Tonight I’ll tell my father.

914
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:02,394
Why George. I don’t see why you have to decide right now—

915
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,480
It’s a whole year away.

916
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:12,566
Emily, I’m glad you spoke to me about that—

917
01:32:14,652 --> 01:32:17,652
that fault in my character but there was one thing wrong.

918
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:22,738
namely that for a year now I didn't pay attention to anyone, and...

919
01:32:24,824 --> 01:32:27,824
You, for example. You say you were watchin’ me when I did everything—

920
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,910
Why, I was doing the same about you.

921
01:32:34,997 --> 01:32:37,997
I always thought about you as one of the chief people I thought about.

922
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:43,083
I always made sure where you were  sitting on the bleachers. And we talked a lot in school

923
01:32:45,169 --> 01:32:48,169
and that was really important to me.

924
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:53,255
Of course it wasn’t as good as the conversation we’re having right now.

925
01:32:55,341 --> 01:32:58,341
Then, lately, I started to observe that you act a bit strange with me.

926
01:33:00,427 --> 01:33:03,427
And for three months not I’ve tried to walk home with you; but something's always got in the way.

927
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:08,513
Yesterday, I was waiting for you, and you walked home with Miss Corcoran.

928
01:33:10,599 --> 01:33:13,599
Oh, George!— Life’s awful funny! How could I have known that?

929
01:33:15,685 --> 01:33:18,685
I thought—

930
01:33:20,772 --> 01:33:23,772
Listen, Emily, I’m going to tell you why I’m not going to Agricultural School.

931
01:33:25,858 --> 01:33:28,858
I think once you’ve found a person you’re very fond of—

932
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:33,944
and fond of you, enough to be interested in your character—

933
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:39,030
Well, I think that’s just as important as college is,

934
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:44,116
even more so. That ’s my opinion.

935
01:33:46,202 --> 01:33:49,202
I think that’s awfully important, too.

936
01:33:51,288 --> 01:33:54,288
– Emily— – Y—yes, George.

937
01:33:56,374 --> 01:33:59,374
Emily, if I make a big change: could you be—

938
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:04,460
I—I am now ... and always have been ...

939
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:14,633
So I guess—this is an important talk we've been having—

940
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,719
Yes , yes.

941
01:34:26,891 --> 01:34:29,891
Wait a second . Then I ’ll walk you home.

942
01:34:31,977 --> 01:34:34,977
Mr. Morgan, I’ll— I’ll have to go home and get the money.

943
01:34:37,063 --> 01:34:40,063
What’s that? George Gibbs, do you mean to tell me—

944
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:45,149
Yes. But I had important motivations, Mr . Morgan.

945
01:34:47,235 --> 01:34:50,235
Look—here’s my gold watch to keep until I come back.

946
01:34:52,322 --> 01:34:55,322
That’s all right. Keep your watch. I’ll trust you.

947
01:34:57,408 --> 01:35:00,408
I’ll be back in five minutes.

948
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:10,580
I’ll trust you ten years, George — not a day over.—

949
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:15,666
Got all over your shock, Emily?

950
01:35:17,752 --> 01:35:20,752
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morgan— it was nothing.

951
01:35:22,838 --> 01:35:25,838
I’m ready to go .

952
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:36,010
Well, now we’ll get on to the wedding.

953
01:35:38,097 --> 01:35:41,097
There are a lot of things to be said about a wedding,

954
01:35:43,183 --> 01:35:46,183
and during the wedding there can be a lot to think about.

955
01:35:48,269 --> 01:35:51,269
We can’t get them all into one wedding, naturally,—

956
01:35:53,355 --> 01:35:56,355
especially not in Grover’s Corners,

957
01:35:58,441 --> 01:36:01,441
where weddings are mighty short and plain.

958
01:36:08,613 --> 01:36:11,613
In this play I take the part of the minister.

959
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:16,699
That gives me the right to say a few things more.

960
01:36:18,785 --> 01:36:21,785
Yes, for a while now the play gets pretty serious.

961
01:36:23,872 --> 01:36:26,872
Y'see,—some churches say that marriage is a sacrament.

962
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,958
I don't know what that means exactly, but I have my suspicions.

963
01:36:34,044 --> 01:36:37,044
People are supposed to live two-by-two – li ke Mrs. Gibbs said a few minutes ago .

964
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:42,130
A wedding is a god thing. But even during such a joyful occasion,

965
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:47,216
many doubts quietly creep into the heart.

966
01:36:49,302 --> 01:36:52,302
Has the moment truly come for me to take this important step?

967
01:36:54,388 --> 01:36:57,388
Is this person beside me really the one and only

968
01:36:59,474 --> 01:37:02,474
whom God and fate have destined for me?

969
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,560
Like one of those European fellas said: Every time a child is born into the world

970
01:37:09,647 --> 01:37:12,647
it’s Nature’s attempt to make a perfect human being.

971
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:17,733
Well, we’ve seen Nature pushing and contriving for some time now.

972
01:37:19,819 --> 01:37:22,819
We know she’s interested in quantity; but I think she’s interested in quality, too.

973
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:27,905
Maybe she's tryin’ to make another good Governor for New Hampshire.

974
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:32,991
That’s what Emily hopes.

975
01:37:40,163 --> 01:37:43,163
And don't forget the other witnesses, the ancestors.

976
01:37:45,249 --> 01:37:48,249
Millions of them. Most of them set out to live two-by-two.

977
01:37:55,422 --> 01:37:58,422
Hope. T hat’s all my sermon. Twan’t very long anyway.

978
01:38:05,594 --> 01:38:08,594
I don’t know why I’m crying. I guess I have no reason to cry.

979
01:38:15,766 --> 01:38:18,766
This morning at breakfast it came over me. There was Emily eating breakfast

980
01:38:20,852 --> 01:38:23,852
as she’s done for 17 years—

981
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:28,938
And now she’s going to eat in someone else's house in the morning.

982
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,110
I suppose that’s it— And Emily suddenly said: ‘’ I can’t eat another mouthful.’’

983
01:38:41,197 --> 01:38:44,197
And she put her head on the table and she cried.

984
01:38:51,369 --> 01:38:54,369
T here’s something downright cruel about sending girls

985
01:38:56,455 --> 01:38:59,455
out into marriages.

986
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:04,541
I hope she heard something from one of her friends.

987
01:39:06,627 --> 01:39:09,627
It’s—it’s cruel, I know; but I just couldn’t get myself to say anything …

988
01:39:11,713 --> 01:39:14,713
I went into it as blind as a bat myself.

989
01:39:21,885 --> 01:39:24,885
The whole world’s wrong, that’s what’s the matter.

990
01:39:32,058 --> 01:39:35,058
Eh, George!

991
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:40,144
Look at him, fellas. He’s scared to death!

992
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:45,230
George! You don’t have to look so innocent, you old geezer.

993
01:39:47,316 --> 01:39:50,316
We know what you’re thinking. Go to it, big boy, y’ old geezer you.

994
01:39:52,402 --> 01:39:55,402
All right! That’s enough of that.

995
01:39:57,488 --> 01:40:00,488
There used to be an awful lot of that kind of thing in weddings in the old days

996
01:40:02,574 --> 01:40:05,574
We’re more civilized now,—so they say.

997
01:40:12,746 --> 01:40:15,746
George! What’s the matter?

998
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:20,833
Ma, I don’t want to grow old! Why’s everybody pushing me so?

999
01:40:22,919 --> 01:40:25,919
– Why, George—you wanted it. – No, Ma, listen to me—

1000
01:40:28,005 --> 01:40:31,005
No, no, George—you’re a man now I

1001
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:36,091
Listen, Ma—for the last time I ask you. All I want to do is to be a fella—

1002
01:40:38,177 --> 01:40:41,177
George! If anyone should hear you! Why, I’m ashamed of you!

1003
01:40:43,263 --> 01:40:46,263
What? Where’s Emily?

1004
01:40:48,349 --> 01:40:51,349
George, you gave me such a fright.

1005
01:40:53,435 --> 01:40:56,435
Cheer up, Ma. I’m getting married.

1006
01:40:58,521 --> 01:41:01,521
Let me catch my breath.

1007
01:41:03,608 --> 01:41:06,608
Ma, you save Thursday nights

1008
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:11,694
Emily and I are coming over to dinner every Thursday night.

1009
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,780
Why, Ma.What are you crying for? Come on. We got to get ready.

1010
01:41:18,866 --> 01:41:21,866
I never felt so alone in my whole life.

1011
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:26,952
And George, over there—I hate him— I wish I were dead. Papa! Papa!

1012
01:41:29,038 --> 01:41:32,038
– Emily! Now don’t get upset— – But, Papa,—I don’t want to get married—

1013
01:41:34,124 --> 01:41:37,124
Sh-h—Emily—Everything’s all right.

1014
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:42,210
Why can’t I stay for a while just as I am? Let’s go away—

1015
01:41:44,296 --> 01:41:47,296
No, no,— Now think a minute.

1016
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:52,383
Don't you remember what you used to say—that I was your girl.

1017
01:41:54,469 --> 01:41:57,469
There must be lots of places we can go to.

1018
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:02,555
I'd work for you. I could keep house.

1019
01:42:04,641 --> 01:42:07,641
Sh! You musn't think of such things. You're just nervous, Emily.

1020
01:42:14,813 --> 01:42:17,813
George! George! Will you come here a minute!

1021
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:22,899
Why, you're marrying the best young fellow in the world. George is a great boy.

1022
01:42:24,985 --> 01:42:27,985
I’m giving away my daughter, George. Can you take care of her?

1023
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:33,071
I want to— I ’ll try. Emily, I'm going to do my best.

1024
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:38,158
I love you. I need you.

1025
01:42:40,244 --> 01:42:43,244
Well, if you love me, help me— all I want is someone to love me.

1026
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:48,330
I will, Emily, I'll try.

1027
01:42:50,416 --> 01:42:53,416
And I mean forever. Do you hear? Forever.

1028
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:03,588
Come, they're waiting for us. Now, you know it’ll be all right.

1029
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,760
Doesn’t she make a lovely bride?

1030
01:43:20,933 --> 01:43:23,933
Do you, George, take this woman, Emily, to be your wedded wife,

1031
01:43:26,019 --> 01:43:29,019
to have and to hold from this day forward,

1032
01:43:31,105 --> 01:43:34,105
in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer,

1033
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:39,191
to love and to cherish till death do us part?

1034
01:43:41,277 --> 01:43:44,277
Loveliest wedding I ever saw.

1035
01:43:46,363 --> 01:43:49,363
I really like lovely weddings. Doesn’t she make a lovely bride?

1036
01:43:51,449 --> 01:43:54,449
Yes.

1037
01:43:56,535 --> 01:43:59,535
Do you, Emily, take this man, George, to be your wedded husband?

1038
01:44:01,621 --> 01:44:04,621
Don’t know when I’ve seen such a lovely wedding.

1039
01:44:06,708 --> 01:44:09,708
But I always cry. I just like to see young people happy.

1040
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:14,794
Don’t you? Oh, I think it’s lovely!

1041
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,880
…till death do you part?

1042
01:44:21,966 --> 01:44:24,966
I do!

1043
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:30,052
The ring!

1044
01:44:37,224 --> 01:44:40,224
I’ve married two hundred couples.

1045
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:45,310
Do I believe in it? I don’t know. I suppose so. X marries Y.. .

1046
01:44:52,483 --> 01:44:55,483
The cottage, the go-cart, the Sunday afternoon drives with the Ford —

1047
01:44:57,569 --> 01:45:00,569
the first rheumatism—the grandchildren— the second rheumatism—the deathbed—

1048
01:45:02,655 --> 01:45:05,655
the reading of the will— Once in a thousand times it’s interesting.

1049
01:45:12,827 --> 01:45:15,827
Let’s hear it!

1050
01:45:22,999 --> 01:45:25,999
Aren’t they a lovely couple?

1051
01:45:28,085 --> 01:45:31,085
I’ve never been on such a lovely wedding.

1052
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:36,171
I'm sure they'll be happy. I always say: happiness!

1053
01:45:38,258 --> 01:45:41,258
This is the most important thing in life! The important thing is to be happy.

1054
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:51,430
That’s the second act . Let ’s go breath in some fresh air.

1055
01:45:58,602 --> 01:46:01,602
This time nine years have gone by, friends— summer, 19 1 3

1056
01:46:03,688 --> 01:46:06,688
Gradual changes have taken place in Grover's Corners.

1057
01:46:08,774 --> 01:46:11,774
Horses are gettin’ rarer. Farmers coming into town now in Fords.

1058
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,860
Everybody locks their house doors at night. Ain't been any burglars in town yet,

1059
01:46:18,946 --> 01:46:21,946
but everybody’s heard about ’em.

1060
01:46:24,033 --> 01:46:27,033
You’d be surprised though—on the whole, things don’t change much i n Grover ’s Corners .

1061
01:46:34,205 --> 01:46:37,205
This is certainly an important part of our town.

1062
01:46:44,377 --> 01:46:47,377
It’s on a hilltop—lots of sky, lots of clouds,—

1063
01:46:49,463 --> 01:46:52,463
often lots of sun and moon and stars.

1064
01:46:54,549 --> 01:46:57,549
I often wonder why people like to be buried in Woodlawn and Brooklyn .

1065
01:46:59,635 --> 01:47:02,635
when they might pass the same time her e .

1066
01:47:09,808 --> 01:47:12,808
Over here are the old stones : 16 7 , 16 8

1067
01:47:14,894 --> 01:47:17,894
Strong- minded people that come a long ways to be independent

1068
01:47:25,066 --> 01:47:28,066
Summer people walk around there laughing

1069
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:33,152
at the funny words on the tombstones.

1070
01:47:35,238 --> 01:47:38,238
Over there—are some Civil War veterans. —

1071
01:47:40,324 --> 01:47:43,324
Iron pennants are on their tombstones.

1072
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:48,410
Had a notion that the Union ought to be kept together,

1073
01:47:50,496 --> 01:47:53,496
though they’d never seen more than fifty miles of it themselves.

1074
01:47:55,583 --> 01:47:58,583
All they knew was the name : the United States of America.

1075
01:48:00,669 --> 01:48:03,669
And they went and died about it.

1076
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:13,841
This here is the new part of the cemetery.

1077
01:48:15,927 --> 01:48:18,927
There’s your friend, Mrs. Gibbs.

1078
01:48:21,013 --> 01:48:24,013
And here's Mr. Stimson, the Congregational Church organist.

1079
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:29,099
And Mrs. Soames who enjoyed the weddin' so much, remember?

1080
01:48:31,185 --> 01:48:34,185
Oh, and a lot of others. Wall y , whose appendix burst

1081
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:39,271
while he was on a Boy Scout trip in Crawford Notch .

1082
01:48:41,358 --> 01:48:44,358
Mr. Carter, Mrs. Grover, the Cartwright family...

1083
01:48:46,444 --> 01:48:49,444
Yes, an awful lot of sorrow here.

1084
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:54,530
People wild with grief have brought their relatives up to this hill ,

1085
01:48:56,616 --> 01:48:59,616
—-and then times—sunny days—

1086
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:04,702
rainy days— snow— You know how it is.

1087
01:49:06,788 --> 01:49:09,788
A lot of thoughts come up here, night and day, but no post office—

1088
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,960
We all know that something is eternal And it ain’t houses or names,

1089
01:49:22,046 --> 01:49:25,046
and it ain’t earth, and it ain’t even the stars ...

1090
01:49:27,133 --> 01:49:30,133
everybody knows in their bones that something is eternal ,

1091
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:35,219
and th at something has to do with human beings .

1092
01:49:37,305 --> 01:49:40,305
All the greatest people ever lived have been telling us that for five thousand years .

1093
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:45,391
and yet you’d be surprised how people are always letting go of that fact.

1094
01:49:52,563 --> 01:49:55,563
There’s something way down deep that’s eternal about every human being.

1095
01:49:57,649 --> 01:50:00,649
Y’know, the dead don’t stay interested in us living people for very long.

1096
01:50:02,735 --> 01:50:05,735
Gradually, they let go hold of the earth—

1097
01:50:07,821 --> 01:50:10,821
and their ambitions their pleasures —

1098
01:50:12,908 --> 01:50:15,908
and the people they loved.

1099
01:50:17,994 --> 01:50:20,994
They get weaned away from earth , like a weaned infant from its mother's breast.

1100
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,080
Yes, they stay here while the earth-part of ’em burns away,

1101
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:31,166
and all that time they slowly get indifferent to what’s goin’ on in Grover’s Corners.

1102
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:36,252
They’re waitin' for something they feel is cornin’.

1103
01:50:38,338 --> 01:50:41,338
Aren’t they waitin’ for the eternal part in them to come out—clear?

1104
01:50:43,424 --> 01:50:46,424
Some of the things they’re going to say maybe’ll hurt your feelings—

1105
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:51,510
but that’s the way it is: mother 'n daughter —husband ’n wife—enemy ‘n enemy—

1106
01:50:53,596 --> 01:50:56,596
money ‘n miser— all those important things grow pale around here.

1107
01:50:58,683 --> 01:51:01,683
And what's left? What’s left when memory’s gone?

1108
01:51:03,769 --> 01:51:06,769
Well, here are some living people.

1109
01:51:08,855 --> 01:51:11,855
There’s Joe Stoddard, our undertaker .

1110
01:51:13,941 --> 01:51:16,941
And here comes Sam Craig, a Grover’s Corners boy that left town to go out West

1111
01:51:24,113 --> 01:51:27,113
Good afternoon, Joe Stoddard

1112
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:32,199
Good afternoon , good afternoon . Let me see now: do I know you?

1113
01:51:39,371 --> 01:51:42,371
I’m Sam Craig.

1114
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:47,458
I should have know n you’d be back for the funeral.

1115
01:51:49,544 --> 01:51:52,544
You’ve been away a long time, Sam.

1116
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:57,630
Yes, over twelve years. I’m in business in Buffalo now, Joe—

1117
01:51:59,716 --> 01:52:02,716
But I was in the East when I got news of my cousin’s death, so I thought

1118
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:07,802
I’d come back and see the old home— You look well.

1119
01:52:14,974 --> 01:52:17,974
Yes, yes, can’t complain— Very sad, our journey today, Samuel.

1120
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:23,060
Yes.

1121
01:52:25,146 --> 01:52:28,146
Yes, yes. I always say, I hate to supervise

1122
01:52:30,233 --> 01:52:33,233
when a young person is taken. They’ll be here in a few minutes now.

1123
01:52:35,319 --> 01:52:38,319
I had to come here early today— my son’s supervisin' at the home ...

1124
01:52:45,491 --> 01:52:48,491
Old Farmer McCarthy! I used to do chores for him after school.

1125
01:52:50,577 --> 01:52:53,577
He had lumbago.

1126
01:52:55,663 --> 01:52:58,663
Yes, we brought Farmer McCarthy here a number of years ago now.

1127
01:53:05,835 --> 01:53:08,835
Why, this is my Aunt Julia— I’d forgotten that she’d—of course!

1128
01:53:10,921 --> 01:53:13,921
Yes, D r. Gibbs lost his wife two-three years ago—about this time.

1129
01:53:16,008 --> 01:53:19,008
Today’s another bad blow for him. ..

1130
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:29,180
That’s my sister Carrie’s boy Sam—Sam Craig.

1131
01:53:31,266 --> 01:53:34,266
I’m always uncomfortable when they’re around.

1132
01:53:41,438 --> 01:53:44,438
Do they choose their own verses much, Joe?

1133
01:53:46,524 --> 01:53:49,524
No—not usual. Mostly the leftovers pick a verse.

1134
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:54,610
Doesn't sound like Aunt Julia.

1135
01:53:56,696 --> 01:53:59,696
Well, there aren’t many of those Hersey sisters left now.

1136
01:54:01,782 --> 01:54:04,782
I wanted to look at my father’s and mother’s—

1137
01:54:06,869 --> 01:54:09,869
Over there with the Craigs, Avenue F.

1138
01:54:17,041 --> 01:54:20,041
Simon Stimson... He was organist at church, wasn’t he? Drank a lot , we used to say.

1139
01:54:22,127 --> 01:54:25,127
Nobody was supposed to know about it. He's been through a lot of trouble.

1140
01:54:27,213 --> 01:54:30,213
Took his own life .

1141
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:35,299
Oh, did he?

1142
01:54:37,385 --> 01:54:40,385
Hung himself in the attic. They tried to hash it up, but of course it got around.

1143
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:45,471
Chose his own epitaph. It ain’t a verse exactly.

1144
01:54:47,557 --> 01:54:50,557
Why, it’s just some notes of music— what is it?

1145
01:54:52,644 --> 01:54:55,644
Oh, I wouldn’t know. It was wrote up in the Boston papers at the time.

1146
01:55:02,816 --> 01:55:05,816
– W hat did she die of? – Who?

1147
01:55:07,902 --> 01:55:10,902
My cousin.

1148
01:55:12,988 --> 01:55:15,988
Had some trouble bringing a baby into the world. ’Was her second, though.

1149
01:55:18,074 --> 01:55:21,074
There's a little boy ’bout four years old.

1150
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,160
And th is is her grave ?

1151
01:55:28,246 --> 01:55:31,246
Yes, there ain’t much more room over here among the Gibbses,

1152
01:55:33,332 --> 01:55:36,332
so they’re opening up a whole new Gibbs section over by Avenue B.

1153
01:55:38,419 --> 01:55:41,419
You’ll excuse me now. I see they’re cornin’.

1154
01:55:43,505 --> 01:55:46,505
– Who is it, Julia? – My daughter-in-law, Emily Webb.

1155
01:55:48,591 --> 01:55:51,591
Well, I declare! The road up here must have been awfully muddy.

1156
01:55:53,677 --> 01:55:56,677
What did she die of?

1157
01:55:58,763 --> 01:56:01,763
In childbirth.

1158
01:56:03,849 --> 01:56:06,849
Childbirth! I’d forgotten all about that!

1159
01:56:08,935 --> 01:56:11,935
My, wasn’t life awful — and wonderful.

1160
01:56:14,021 --> 01:56:17,021
– Wonderful, was it? – Simon! Now, remember!

1161
01:56:19,107 --> 01:56:22,107
I remember Emily’s lovely wedding. What a lovely wedding it was!

1162
01:56:24,194 --> 01:56:27,194
And her reading the class poem at Graduation Exercises.

1163
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,280
Emily was one of the brightest girls ever graduated from High School.

1164
01:56:34,366 --> 01:56:37,366
I’ve heard Principal Wilkins say so time after time.

1165
01:56:39,452 --> 01:56:42,452
I called on them at their new farm, just before I died. Perfectly beautiful farm.

1166
01:56:44,538 --> 01:56:47,538
It's on the same road we lived on, hm-hm.

1167
01:56:49,624 --> 01:56:52,624
Aya, right smart farm.

1168
01:56:54,710 --> 01:56:57,710
I always liked that song . I hoped they’ll sing.

1169
01:57:04,882 --> 01:57:07,882
Good afternoon !

1170
01:57:15,055 --> 01:57:18,055
– Good afternoon , Emily! – Good afternoon , M’s Gibbs!

1171
01:57:25,227 --> 01:57:28,227
– Good afternoon , Mother Gibbs! – Emily!

1172
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:38,399
Good a f ternoon.

1173
01:57:40,485 --> 01:57:43,485
It’s raining!

1174
01:57:45,571 --> 01:57:48,571
Yes— They’ll be gone soon. Just rest.

1175
01:57:55,744 --> 01:57:58,744
It seems thousands and thousands of years since I—

1176
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:03,830
Papa remembered my favorite song .

1177
01:58:11,002 --> 01:58:14,002
Oh, I wish I’d been here a long time! I don’t like being new here !

1178
01:58:21,174 --> 01:58:24,174
– Goo d afternoon , Mr. Stimson ! – Goo d afternoon !

1179
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:29,260
Mother Gibbs, George and I have made that farm

1180
01:58:31,346 --> 01:58:34,346
into the best place you ever saw. We thought of you all the time.

1181
01:58:36,432 --> 01:58:39,432
We wanted to show you the new barn and a great long cement drinking fountain

1182
01:58:41,519 --> 01:58:44,519
for the stock. We bought that out of the money you left us.

1183
01:58:46,605 --> 01:58:49,605
I did?

1184
01:58:51,691 --> 01:58:54,691
Don’t you remember, Mother Gibbs— the legacy you left us?

1185
01:58:56,777 --> 01:58:59,777
Why, it was over three hundred and fifty dollars !

1186
01:59:01,863 --> 01:59:04,863
Yes, yes, Emily.

1187
01:59:06,949 --> 01:59:09,949
Well, there’s a patent device on this drinking-fountain so that it never overflows .

1188
01:59:12,035 --> 01:59:15,035
And it never sinks below a certain mark. G reat invention !

1189
01:59:22,207 --> 01:59:25,207
It won’t be the same to George without me, but it’s a lovely farm.

1190
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:35,380
Live people don’t understand, do they?

1191
01:59:37,466 --> 01:59:40,466
No, dear—not very much.

1192
01:59:47,638 --> 01:59:50,638
They’re sort of shut up in little boxes, aren’t they?

1193
01:59:52,724 --> 01:59:55,724
I feel as tho I knew ’em last a thousand years ago—

1194
01:59:57,810 --> 02:00:00,810
My boy is spending the day at Mrs. Carter’s.

1195
02:00:02,896 --> 02:00:05,896
Oh, Mr. Carter, my little boy is spending the day at your house.

1196
02:00:07,982 --> 02:00:10,982
Yes, he loves it there. ..

1197
02:00:13,069 --> 02:00:16,069
Mother Gibbs, we have a Ford, too. Never gives any trouble.

1198
02:00:18,155 --> 02:00:21,155
I don’t drive, though. Mother Gibbs, when does this feeling go away?

1199
02:00:23,241 --> 02:00:26,241
Of being one of them? How long does it ?

1200
02:00:33,413 --> 02:00:36,413
I know .

1201
02:00:38,499 --> 02:00:41,499
Look, they're finished. They’re going.

1202
02:00:43,585 --> 02:00:46,585
Just wait and be patient.

1203
02:00:53,757 --> 02:00:56,757
Look! Father Gibbs is bringing some flowers to you.

1204
02:00:58,844 --> 02:01:01,844
He looks just like George, doesn’t he?

1205
02:01:09,016 --> 02:01:12,016
Oh, Mother Gibbs, I never realized before how troubled and how —

1206
02:01:14,102 --> 02:01:17,102
how in the dark live persons are. Look at him. I loved him so.

1207
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:22,188
From morning till night, that’s all they are—troubled.

1208
02:01:24,274 --> 02:01:27,274
Little cooler than it was. ..

1209
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,360
Aya, that rain’s cooled it off a little.

1210
02:01:34,446 --> 02:01:37,446
Those northeast winds always do the same thing?

1211
02:01:39,532 --> 02:01:42,532
If it ain’t a rain, it’s a three-day blow. ..

1212
02:01:44,619 --> 02:01:47,619
But Mother Gibbs, one can go back; one can go back there again into living!

1213
02:01:49,705 --> 02:01:52,705
I feel it! I know it!

1214
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:57,791
Why just then for a moment I was thinking about the farm—

1215
02:01:59,877 --> 02:02:02,877
and for a minute I was there and my baby was on my lap as plain as day!

1216
02:02:04,963 --> 02:02:07,963
Yes, of course you can.

1217
02:02:15,135 --> 02:02:18,135
I can go back there and live those days over again—why not?

1218
02:02:20,221 --> 02:02:23,221
All I can say is, Emily, don’t.

1219
02:02:25,307 --> 02:02:28,307
But it’s true, isn’t it? I can go and live— back there—again.

1220
02:02:30,394 --> 02:02:33,394
Yes, some have tried, but they come back.

1221
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:38,480
Don’t do it, Emily.

1222
02:02:40,566 --> 02:02:43,566
Emily, don’t. It’s not what you think it’d be.

1223
02:02:45,652 --> 02:02:48,652
But I won’t live over a sad day. I'll choose a happy one .

1224
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:53,738
I’ll choose the day I first knew that I loved George.

1225
02:02:55,824 --> 02:02:58,824
Would that be painful?

1226
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:03,910
You not only live it; but you watch yourself living it.

1227
02:03:05,996 --> 02:03:08,996
And as you watch it, you see the thing that they never know.

1228
02:03:11,082 --> 02:03:14,082
You see t he future. You know what’s going to happen afterwards.

1229
02:03:16,169 --> 02:03:19,169
But is that—painful? Why?

1230
02:03:21,255 --> 02:03:24,255
That’s not the only reason why you shouldn’t do it, Emily.

1231
02:03:26,341 --> 02:03:29,341
When you’ve been here longer you’ll see that—

1232
02:03:31,427 --> 02:03:34,427
Our life here is to forget all that— and be ready for what is ahead.

1233
02:03:36,513 --> 02:03:39,513
Mother Gibbs, how can I ever forget that life?

1234
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,599
I t’s all I knew. It’s all I had!

1235
02:03:46,685 --> 02:03:49,685
Oh, Emily! It isn’t wise. Really, it isn’t.

1236
02:03:51,771 --> 02:03:54,771
But it’s a thing I must know for myself!

1237
02:03:56,857 --> 02:03:59,857
I’ll choose a happy day, anyway.

1238
02:04:01,944 --> 02:04:04,944
No! At least choose an average day. Choose the least important day in your life.

1239
02:04:12,116 --> 02:04:15,116
It will be important enough.

1240
02:04:22,288 --> 02:04:25,288
Then it can’t be since I was married; or since the baby was born.

1241
02:04:27,374 --> 02:04:30,374
I can choose a birthday, can’t I?

1242
02:04:37,546 --> 02:04:40,546
I choose my twelfth birthday.

1243
02:04:47,719 --> 02:04:50,719
All right.

1244
02:04:57,891 --> 02:05:00,891
It’s February 11th, 1899. A Tuesday.

1245
02:05:08,063 --> 02:05:11,063
Do you want any special time of day?

1246
02:05:13,149 --> 02:05:16,149
I want the whole day!

1247
02:05:23,321 --> 02:05:26,321
We’lt begin at dawn. I t had been snowing for several days;

1248
02:05:28,407 --> 02:05:31,407
but it stopped the night before, and they had begun clearing the roads.

1249
02:05:33,494 --> 02:05:36,494
The sun’s coming up.

1250
02:05:43,666 --> 02:05:46,666
There’s Main Street—why, that’s Mr. Morgan’s sweetshop before he changed it!

1251
02:05:48,752 --> 02:05:51,752
Yes, it’s 1899. Fourteen years ago.

1252
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:56,838
Oh, that’s the town I knew as a little girl .

1253
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:07,010
And, look, there’s the old white fence that used to be around our house.

1254
02:06:09,096 --> 02:06:12,096
Oh, I’d forgotten that! I love it so!

1255
02:06:14,182 --> 02:06:17,182
They... a re they inside?

1256
02:06:19,269 --> 02:06:22,269
Yes, your mother’ll be coming downstairs in a minute to make breakfast.

1257
02:06:24,355 --> 02:06:27,355
Will she?

1258
02:06:29,441 --> 02:06:32,441
And you remember: your father had been away for a couple of days;

1259
02:06:34,527 --> 02:06:37,527
he came back on the early morning train.

1260
02:06:39,613 --> 02:06:42,613
No?

1261
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:47,699
He’d been back to his college to make a speech in New York, Clinton.

1262
02:06:49,785 --> 02:06:52,785
Look! There’s Howie Newsome! There’s our policeman! But he died!

1263
02:06:59,957 --> 02:07:02,957
Whoa, Bessie!

1264
02:07:05,044 --> 02:07:08,044
Morning, Bill.

1265
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:13,130
Morning, Howie.

1266
02:07:15,216 --> 02:07:18,216
You’re up early.

1267
02:07:20,302 --> 02:07:23,302
Been rescuin’ a party; darn near froze to death,

1268
02:07:25,388 --> 02:07:28,388
down by Polish Town there. Got drunk and lay out in the snowdrifts.

1269
02:07:30,474 --> 02:07:33,474
When I woke him up, he thought he was in bed.

1270
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,560
There’s Joe Crowell ...

1271
02:07:40,646 --> 02:07:43,646
Good morning, Joe!

1272
02:07:45,732 --> 02:07:48,732
Good mornin’, Mr. Warren. ’Mornin’, Howie.

1273
02:07:50,818 --> 02:07:53,818
Children! Wally! Emily! Time to get up!

1274
02:07:55,905 --> 02:07:58,905
Mama, I'm here? Oh, how young Mama looks!

1275
02:08:00,991 --> 02:08:03,991
I didn’t know that Mama was ever that young.

1276
02:08:06,077 --> 02:08:09,077
You can come dress by the kitchen fire, if you like, but hurry.

1277
02:08:11,163 --> 02:08:14,163
Good mornin’, Mr. Newsome. Whhh ... it’s cold.

1278
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:19,249
Minus ten grades, Mis’ Webb.

1279
02:08:21,335 --> 02:08:24,335
Think of it! Keep yourself wrapped up.

1280
02:08:26,421 --> 02:08:29,421
Come on, Bessie .

1281
02:08:31,507 --> 02:08:34,507
Mama, I can’t find my blue hair-ribbon anywhere.

1282
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,680
Just open your eyes, dear, that’s all, I laid it out for you special on the dresser, there.

1283
02:08:46,766 --> 02:08:49,766
If it were a snake, it’d bite you.

1284
02:08:51,852 --> 02:08:54,852
Yes . Yes …

1285
02:09:02,024 --> 02:09:05,024
Good mornin', Bill.

1286
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:10,110
Good mornin’, Mr. Webb. You’re up early.

1287
02:09:12,196 --> 02:09:15,196
Yes, just been back to my old college in New York .

1288
02:09:17,282 --> 02:09:20,282
Been any trouble here?

1289
02:09:22,368 --> 02:09:25,368
I was called up this mornin’ to rescue a Polish fella—

1290
02:09:27,455 --> 02:09:30,455
darn near froze to death. ..

1291
02:09:32,541 --> 02:09:35,541
We must get it in the paper.

1292
02:09:42,713 --> 02:09:45,713
How did it go, Charles?

1293
02:09:47,799 --> 02:09:50,799
Oh, fine, I guess. I ’ve told him a few things… Everything all right here?

1294
02:09:52,885 --> 02:09:55,885
Yes—can’t think of anything that’s happened, special. Been right cold.

1295
02:09:57,971 --> 02:10:00,971
Howie Newsome says its ten below over to his barn.

1296
02:10:03,057 --> 02:10:06,057
Yes, well, it's colder than that at Hamilton College. Students’ ears are falling off.

1297
02:10:08,143 --> 02:10:11,143
It ain’t Christian— Paper have any mistakes?

1298
02:10:13,230 --> 02:10:16,230
None that I noticed. Coffee’s ready , you can drink it when you want .

1299
02:10:18,316 --> 02:10:21,316
Charles! Don’t forget; it’s Emily’s birthday. Did you get her anything?

1300
02:10:23,402 --> 02:10:26,402
Yes, I’ve got something here.

1301
02:10:33,574 --> 02:10:36,574
Where’s my birthday girl?

1302
02:10:43,746 --> 02:10:46,746
Don’t interrupt her, Charles. You can see her at breakfast.

1303
02:10:48,832 --> 02:10:51,832
She’s slow enough as it is.

1304
02:10:53,918 --> 02:10:56,918
Hurry up, children! Seven o’clock. Now I don’t want to call you again.

1305
02:10:59,005 --> 02:11:02,005
I can’t bear it. They’re so young and beautiful.

1306
02:11:04,091 --> 02:11:07,091
Why did they ever have to get old? Mama, I’m here! I'm grown up!

1307
02:11:09,177 --> 02:11:12,177
I love you all! I can’t look at everything hard enough.

1308
02:11:19,349 --> 02:11:22,349
Good morning, Mama.

1309
02:11:24,435 --> 02:11:27,435
Good morning, Mama , good morning, Papa .

1310
02:11:29,521 --> 02:11:32,521
Well, a very happy birthday to my girl and many happy returns.

1311
02:11:34,607 --> 02:11:37,607
There are surprises waiting for you on the kitchen table.

1312
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:47,780
Oh, Mama, you shouldn’t have ... I can’t ... I can’t ...

1313
02:11:49,866 --> 02:11:52,866
But birthday or no t birthday, I want you to eat your breakfast good and slow.

1314
02:11:54,952 --> 02:11:57,952
I want you to grow up and be a good strong girl.

1315
02:12:00,038 --> 02:12:03,038
That in the blue paper is from your Aunt Carrie

1316
02:12:05,124 --> 02:12:08,124
and I reckon you can guess who brought the post card album.

1317
02:12:10,210 --> 02:12:13,210
I found it on the doorstep when I brought in the milk …

1318
02:12:15,296 --> 02:12:18,296
George Gibbs— must come over in the cold — nice of him. ..

1319
02:12:20,382 --> 02:12:23,382
George, I’d forgotten that ...

1320
02:12:25,468 --> 02:12:28,468
Chew that bacon slow and well. .

1321
02:12:30,555 --> 02:12:33,555
It’ll help keep you warm on a cold day.

1322
02:12:35,641 --> 02:12:38,641
Mama … look at me one minute as though you really saw me.

1323
02:12:40,727 --> 02:12:43,727
Mama , f ourteen years have gone by! I’m dead! You’re a grandmother , Mama.

1324
02:12:45,813 --> 02:12:48,813
Mama , I married George Gibbs, Mama! Wally’s dead, too.

1325
02:12:50,899 --> 02:12:53,899
Mama! His appendix burst on a camping trip.

1326
02:12:55,985 --> 02:12:58,985
We felt terrible, don’t you remember?

1327
02:13:01,071 --> 02:13:04,071
But, just for a moment now we’re all together— Mama, let’s be happy—

1328
02:13:06,157 --> 02:13:09,157
Let’s look at one another!

1329
02:13:11,243 --> 02:13:14,243
That in the yellow paper is something I found in the attic

1330
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:19,330
among your grandmother’s things.

1331
02:13:21,416 --> 02:13:24,416
You’re old enough to wear it now, and I thought you’d like it.

1332
02:13:26,502 --> 02:13:29,502
And this is from you! Why, Mama, it’s just what I wanted. It's beautiful!

1333
02:13:31,588 --> 02:13:34,588
Your Aunt Norah couldn’t find one in Concord so I had to send

1334
02:13:36,674 --> 02:13:39,674
all the way to Boston. Wally has something for you, too.

1335
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,760
He made it at Manual Training class and he’s very proud of it.

1336
02:13:46,846 --> 02:13:49,846
Be sure you make a big fuss. Your father has a surprise for you, too;

1337
02:13:51,932 --> 02:13:54,932
don’t know what it is myself. Sh—here he comes.

1338
02:14:02,105 --> 02:14:05,105
Where ’s my birthday girl? Happy birthday, Emily!

1339
02:14:07,191 --> 02:14:10,191
Happy birthday to you...

1340
02:14:12,277 --> 02:14:15,277
I can’t go on! It goes so fast.

1341
02:14:17,363 --> 02:14:20,363
We don’t have time to look at one another.

1342
02:14:22,449 --> 02:14:25,449
I didn’t realize.

1343
02:14:27,535 --> 02:14:30,535
So all that was going on and we never noticed!

1344
02:14:37,707 --> 02:14:40,707
Take me back—up the hill— to my grave.

1345
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:50,880
No . W ait!

1346
02:14:58,052 --> 02:15:01,052
One more look .

1347
02:15:08,224 --> 02:15:11,224
Goodbye, goodbye, world .

1348
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:16,310
Goodbye, Grover’s Corners ...

1349
02:15:18,396 --> 02:15:21,396
Mama and Papa ...

1350
02:15:23,482 --> 02:15:26,482
Goodbye to clocks ticking ...

1351
02:15:28,568 --> 02:15:31,568
and my butternut tree! and Mama’s sunflowers— and food and coffee—

1352
02:15:33,655 --> 02:15:36,655
and bacon that always got burnt onto the pan…

1353
02:15:38,741 --> 02:15:41,741
and new-ironed dresses and hot baths—

1354
02:15:43,827 --> 02:15:46,827
and sleeping and waking up!

1355
02:15:48,913 --> 02:15:51,913
Oh, earth… you’re too wonderful for anyone to realize you!

1356
02:15:59,085 --> 02:16:02,085
Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it—

1357
02:16:04,171 --> 02:16:07,171
every, every minute?

1358
02:16:09,257 --> 02:16:12,257
No— Saints and poets maybe—they do some.

1359
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:22,430
I’m ready to go back.

1360
02:16:29,602 --> 02:16:32,602
Were you happy , Emily ?

1361
02:16:39,774 --> 02:16:42,774
No. I should have listened to you , Mother Gibbs . That’s all human beings are!—Just blind people.

1362
02:16:49,946 --> 02:16:52,946
Look, the sky ’s getting clear. The stars are coming out.

1363
02:16:55,032 --> 02:16:58,032
Mr. Stimson, I should have listened to them.

1364
02:17:00,118 --> 02:17:03,118
N ow she know s . Now she know s : that’s what it was to be alive.

1365
02:17:05,205 --> 02:17:08,205
To move about in a cloud of ignorance; to go up and down

1366
02:17:10,291 --> 02:17:13,291
trampling on the feelings of those— of those about you.

1367
02:17:15,377 --> 02:17:18,377
To spend and waste time as though you had a million years.

1368
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:28,549
To be always at the mercy of one self-centered passion, or another.

1369
02:17:30,635 --> 02:17:33,635
T hat’s the ’’happy” existence you wanted to go back to. Now you know ...

1370
02:17:35,721 --> 02:17:38,721
Ignorance and blindness .

1371
02:17:45,893 --> 02:17:48,893
That ain’t the whole truth and you know it, Simon Stimson.

1372
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:53,980
Emily, look at that star. I forget its name.

1373
02:18:01,152 --> 02:18:04,152
My boy Joel was a sailor —knew th em all.

1374
02:18:06,238 --> 02:18:09,238
He’d sit on the porch evenin’s and tell th em all by name. It was wonderful for sure.

1375
02:18:11,324 --> 02:18:14,324
A star’s mighty good company.

1376
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:19,410
Yes , it is .

1377
02:18:21,496 --> 02:18:24,496
Here comes one of them.

1378
02:18:26,582 --> 02:18:29,582
That’s funny! It ain’t no time for th em to be here. Goodness sakes!

1379
02:18:31,668 --> 02:18:34,668
Mother Gibbs! It’s George!

1380
02:18:36,755 --> 02:18:39,755
Sh-h, dear. Just rest yourself.

1381
02:18:41,841 --> 02:18:44,841
It ’s George.

1382
02:18:46,927 --> 02:18:49,927
And my Joel, who knew the stars— he used to say

1383
02:18:52,013 --> 02:18:55,013
it took millions of years for that little speck o’ light to git down to earth.

1384
02:18:57,099 --> 02:19:00,099
T hat's what he used to say ... millions of years.

1385
02:19:02,185 --> 02:19:05,185
Goodness! That ain’t no way to behave.

1386
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:10,271
He ought to be home.

1387
02:19:12,357 --> 02:19:15,357
– Mother Gibbs? – Yes, Emily?

1388
02:19:17,443 --> 02:19:20,443
– They don’t—understand—do they? – No, dear. They don’t understand.

1389
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:30,616
Most everybody’s asleep in Grover’s Corners.

1390
02:19:37,788 --> 02:19:40,788
There are a few lights on;

1391
02:19:42,874 --> 02:19:45,874
Shorty Hawkins, down at the depot, just watched the Boston train go by.

1392
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:50,960
Voices can be heard from Ellerey Greenough's barn.

1393
02:19:53,046 --> 02:19:56,046
Yes, it’s clearing up. There are the stars— making their way,

1394
02:19:58,132 --> 02:20:01,132
their ancient way across the vault of the sky . Scholars haven’t settled the matter yet,

1395
02:20:03,218 --> 02:20:06,218
but they seem to think there are no living beings up there.

1396
02:20:08,305 --> 02:20:11,305
Just chalk—or fire.

1397
02:20:18,477 --> 02:20:21,477
Only this one is straining away to make something of itself.

1398
02:20:23,563 --> 02:20:26,563
The strain’s so great that every sixteen hours everybody lies down and gets a rest.

1399
02:20:33,735 --> 02:20:36,735
Eleven o’clock in Grover’s Corners. Everybody’s goes to sleep.

1400
02:20:38,821 --> 02:20:41,821
Tomorrow starts a new day.

1401
02:20:43,907 --> 02:20:46,907
You get a good rest too. Good night.
