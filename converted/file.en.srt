1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This play is called “Our Town.”

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In it you will see Dr. Gibbs, Mrs. Gibbs, George Gibbs, Rebecca Gibbs,

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Constable Warren, Howie Newsome, Joe Crowell, Si Crowell, Simon Stinson, Mrs. Soames.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The name of our town is Grover’s Corners, New Hampshire

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
just over the line from Massachusetts; latitude 42 degrees,

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
40 minutes, longitude 70 degrees, 37 minutes.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The first act shows a day in our town. The date is May 7, 1901, just before dawn.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sky is showing some streaks of light over in the East there,

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the mornin’ star gets brighter just before it has to go.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, now I’ll show you how our town lies. Here’s Main Street.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Over there on the left is the railroad tracks. The Congregational Church is over there;

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the Presbyterian’s across the street.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Methodist and Unitarian are over there. Baptist is—by the river.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Across the tracks is— the Catholic Church,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Next to the Post Office is the Town Hall; jail is in the basement.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Washington once made a speech from those steps.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is the Main Street. Along Main Street there’s a row of stores.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here are the poles that the horses are tied to.

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
First automobile’s goin’ to come along in about five years—

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
belonged to Banker Cartwright, our richest citizen.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Lives in the big white house on the hill.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here’s the grocery store and Mr. Morgan’s drugstore.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Everyone in town goes to those stores.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is Doctor Gibbs’ house.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is the back door.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Here’s a couple of trellises for those who need scenery.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is Mrs. Gibbs’ garden— Corn… chickpeas... beans... peas... heliotrop

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and lots of weeds.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Back then we got newspapers twice a week—

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the Grover’s Corners Sentinel— this is Editor Webb’s house .

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And Mrs. Webb’s Garden. Just like Mrs. Gibbs’s :

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Corn… chickpeas... beans... peas... but with sunflowers—

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right here ...

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
is a big walnut tree.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Nice town, right?

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Nobody very remarkable ever come out of it.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The earliest dates on the tombstones in the cemetery

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
say 1670–1680. They’re Grovers and Cartwrights

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and Gibbses and Herseys—- same names from here now.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like I said: it’s early morning. The only lights on are in a cottage

41
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
over by the tracks where a Polish mother’s had twins.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And in the Joe Crowell house, where Joe Junior’s gettin’ ready

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to deliver the paper.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And in the depot, where Shorty Hawkins is gettin’ ready

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to flag the 5.45 train for Boston. Aya—there she is.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
A ll around, they’ve been lights on for some time, what with milkin’ and so on.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But town folks sleep late. So—another day’s begun.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Here comes Doc tor Gibbs down the Main Street , returning from that baby case.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And here’s Mrs. Gibbs coming down to begin breakfast.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Doc tor Gibbs died in 1930. New hospital’s named after him.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Mrs. Gibbs died of pneumonia visiting her daughter Rebecca,

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
who married an insurance man in Canton, Ohio,

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and died there of pneumonia, but her body was brought back here.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She’s buried in that cemetery—

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
she was Julia Hersey before she married Dr. Gibbs

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
in the Congregational Church.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In our town we like to know the facts about everybody.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There’s Mrs. Webb starting breakfast too.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And here comes Joe Crowell deliverin' the paper.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
– Good m ornin g , D r. Gobbs! – Good m ornin g , Joe!

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
– Want your paper now? – Yes, I’ll take it.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Anybody been sick?

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No. Some twins born in Polish Town —

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I see your teacher Miss Foster is getting married.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, sir, to a man in Concord.

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, how do you boys feel about that?

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, it’s not my business— but I think

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
if a person starts out to be a teacher she should stay one.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How’s your knee, Joe?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Fine, Doc tor . Only like you said, it tells me

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
when it’s going to rain.

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
– Is it telling you rain today? – No.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
– Sure? – Yes , sir.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
– Knee ever make a mistake? – No sir.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I want to tell you something about that boy. Joe was smart—

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
graduated top of his class.

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He got a scholarship to Boston Tech—M.I.T.

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Graduated top of his class from there too.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It was in all the Boston papers at the time.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Joe was going to be an engineering, but the war started

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and he died in France.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All that education for nothing. What business he had fighting the Germans

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
we don’t know now, but it seemed perfectly clear at the time.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Here comes Howie Newsome delivering milk.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Giddy up, Bessie. What’s the matter with you?

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
– Bună dimineața , Doc tor ! – Bună dimineața , Howie!

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
– Somebody sick? – Pair of twins over to Mrs. Goruslawski’s.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Twins, eh? This town’s gettin’ bigger every year.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Going to rain, Howie?

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No. Fine day, with sunshine, no joke. Come on, Bessie.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hello, Bessie! How old is she?

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Almost seventeen. Bessie’s been confused since the Lockharts

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
cancelled their milk delivery. She wants to head that way

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and yells at me the whole time.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
– Good morning, Mis’ Gibbs. – Good morning, Howie!

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Doc tor ’s comin’ down the street.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is he? Seems like you’re late today.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Aya. Something went wrong with the cart this morning. I don’t know what happened.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Children, time to get up!

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Come on, Bessie!

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Everything ok, Frank?

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes. Easy as kittens.

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Bacon will be ready soon. Come drink your coffee.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Can you get some more sleep this morning?

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Mrs. Wentworth’s cornin’ at eleven with a stomach issue.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I know what’s her problem. Her stomach is not the same as it was.

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You won’t get more than three hours sleep. Frank Gibbs, I don't know

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
what’s goin’ to become of you. I  wish you could rest more.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It would do you good.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Emily! Wake up! Wally! Seven o’clock!

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You’ve got to speak to George. Somethin’s come over him lately. He’s no help.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can’t even get him to cut me wood.

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is he sassy to you?

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, just whines! All he thinks about is baseball—

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
George! Rebecca! You’ll be late for school.

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
George! George, look sharp!

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
– Yes, Pa! – Don’t you hear your mother?

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Walleee! Wash yourself good or I’ll do it myself.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I’m going to lie down.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wash yourself good or I’ll do it myself.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ma! What dress shall I wear?

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Be quiet ! Your father’s been out all night and needs his sleep.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I washed and ironed your blue dress.

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
– Oh, Ma, I hate that dress. – Oh, hush.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Every day I go to school dressed like— like a sick turkey.

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Y ou always look lovely.

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Mama, George’s throwin’ soap at me!

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll be right up to slap you both .

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We got a factory in our town, too. Hear it?

130
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Makes blankets. Cartwrights own it, made  a fortune.

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Children! Now slow down.

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Breakfast is just as important as lunch or dinner. I won’t have you gobblin’ like wolves.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You will not grow, if you eat like that... That ’s for sure. Wally, put away your book!

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, Ma! By ten o’clock I got to know about Canada.

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know the rules — no books at table.

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I’d rather have my children healthy than bright.

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I’m both, Mama, you know I am.

138
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I’m the brightest girl in school my age. I have a very good memory.

139
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Eat your breakfast.

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I’ll speak to your father. Twenty-five cents a week’s enough

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
for a boy of your age.

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don’t know how you spend it all.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Aw, Ma,—I gotta lotta things to buy.

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Strawberry phosphates— that’s what you spend it on.

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don’t see why Rebecca gets much money. She has more  than a dollar.

146
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I’ve been saving up.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, I think it’s good to spend some every now an’ then.

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Mama, you know what I love most in the world? Money.

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Eat your breakfast.

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's the bell. I gotta go.

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Don’t run. Wally, pull up your pants.

152
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Rebecca, t ell Miss Foster I send her my best. Can you remember that?

153
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, Ma.

154
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You look nice, Rebecca. Pick up your feet!

155
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Here, here— No, you go away,— Here— What's the matter with you?

156
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
All you do is fight— You don’t belong to me. Where'd you come from?

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Good morning, Myrtle. How’s your cold?

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, I still have a tickle in my throat. Told Charles I didn’t know

159
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
if I’d go to choir rehearsal tonight.

160
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Have you tried singing at a higher pitch ?

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes, but I can’t stay on key. While I’m restin' I thought

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I’d string some beans.

163
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let me help. Beans have been good this year.

164
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Aya, I want to have forty quarts if it kills me. Children say they hate ’em

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
but they’ll eat them all winter.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Look, Myrtle, I have to tell you something. If I don’t tell somebody I’ll burst.

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why Julia Gibbs!

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Tell me, Myrtle, is one of those

169
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
second-hand furniture men come to see you?

170
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No !

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, he visited me. First I thought he was

172
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
one of Doctor Gibbs’ patients. He came inside

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and offered me 350 dollars for Grandmother Wentworth's highboy.

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why, Julia Gibbs!

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes, yes. On that old thing. It was so big I didn’t know where to put it.

176
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I almost give it to my cousin, Hester Wilcox

177
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
– Well, you’re going to take it, aren’t you? – I don't know.

178
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You don’t know!—three hundred and fifty dollars? What’s come over you?

179
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If I could get my husband to use the money for a trip,

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I’d sell it like that.

181
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You know, Myrtil, I’ve always wanted to see Paris, France.

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I’ve been promising myself for years that if we ever had the chance-—

183
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
How’s Doctor feel about it?

184
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, I said if I got an inheritance—

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
that’s the way I put it— I’d make him take me.

186
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
M-m-m— What did he say?

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You know how he is. I haven’t heard a serious word out of him, since I’ve known him.

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No, he said, it might make him discontented

189
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
with Grover’s Corners to go to Europe;

190
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Every two years he makes a trip to the battlefields of the Civil War

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and that’s enough he says.

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, Mr. Webb just admires the way Doctor Gibbs knows everything about the Civil War.

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mr. Webb’s ready to give up Napoleon and move over to the Civil War – hopeless – ,

194
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
only Doctor Gibbs being one of the greatest experts in the country makes him despair.

195
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It’s a fact, my husband is never so happy as when he’s at Gettysburg.

196
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The times I’ve walked over those hills, Myrtle, stopping at every bush,

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
like we was going to buy it.

198
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Well, if that second-hand man’s serious Julia, you sell it.

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And then you’ll get to see Paris.

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Just keep droppin’ hints —

201
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that’s how I got to see the Atlantic Ocean.

202
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Oh, I’m sorry I mentioned it. Only it seems to me that once in your life,

203
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you ought to see a country where they don’t talk in English

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and don’t even want to.

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Thank you very much, ladies.

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Thank you. Now we’ll skip a few hours.

207
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But first we want a little more information about our town— a scientific account.

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So I’ve asked Professor Willard of our State University to discuss

209
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
our past history here. Professor Willard?

210
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
May I introduce Professor Willard ...

211
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Just a few brief notes, — unfortunately our time is limited.

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Grover’s Corners—mmm— let me see— Grover's Corners lies

213
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
on the old pleiocene granite of the Appalachian range .

214
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
on some of the oldest land in the world—

215
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
we’re proud of that. Of course there are more recent outcroppings,—sandstone showing

216
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
through a shelf of Devonian basalt, and some vestiges of Mezozoic shale,

217
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
but these are comparatively new— perhaps two or three hundred million years.

218
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Some interesting fossils have been found—

219
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
two miles north of the Peckham Farm— in Silas Peckham’s cow-pasture.

220
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
These may be seen in the museum at the University at any reasonable time.

221
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Shall I read some of Professor Gruber’s notes

222
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
on the meteorological situation— mean precipitation, et cetera?

223
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Afraid we won’t have time for that, Professor.

224
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We might have a few words on the history of man here.

225
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
– Oh, anthropological data— – Er—yes.

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Early Amerindian stock, Cotahatchee tribes—

227
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
no evidence before the 10th Century —

228
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
now entirely disappeared— Oh, possible traces in three families—

229
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
migration in early part of the 17th Century

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
of English brachiocephalic blue-eyed stock—

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Since then, some Slav and Mediterranean—

232
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And the population?

233
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
– Within the town limits: 2,640. – The twins are born , p rofessor.

234
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh yes. The population at the moment is 2,642.

235
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The Postal District brings in 507 more—

236
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
making a total of 3,149.

237
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Mortality, birth rates—constant. By McPherson’s gauge: 6.032.

238
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Thank you very much, Professor Willard.

239
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
We are all truly obliged to you.

240
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
– When were the twins born? – Today, a t dawn.

241
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Now the political and social report: Editor Webb .

242
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Oh, Mr. Webb?

243
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He’ll be here soon— He just cut his hand eatin’ an apple.

244
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thank you, Mrs. Webb.

245
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Mr. Webb is Publisher and Editor of The Grover’s Corners Sentinel, our local paper.

246
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Charles, ever ybody’s waiting for you!

247
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, we’re run by a Board of Selectmen.

248
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
All males vote at the age of 21.

249
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Women vote indirect.

250
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
We’re lower middle-class: sprinklin’ of professional men—

251
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and 10% illiterate laborers: unskilled, illiterate workers.

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Politically, 86% Republicans;

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
6% Democrats; 4% Socialists; Rest, indifferent.

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Religiously, 85% Protestants; 12% Catholics;

255
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Rest, indifferent.

256
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Have you any comments, Mr. Webb?

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What do you think of our little town, Grovers Corner’s, Mr Webb?

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well, if you ask me, I can tell you that it ’s a very ordinary town.

259
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Little better behaved than most.

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Probably a lot duller. But our young people here seem to like it well enough .

261
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
90% of ’em settle down right here to live—

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
even when they’ve-been away to college.

263
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We have a few questions from the audience. Row 3, seat 4.

264
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Is there much drinking in Grover’s Corners?

265
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, ma’am, I wouldn’t know what you’d call much.

266
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Saturday nights the farmhands meet down in Ellery Greenough’s stable.

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We’ve got one or two town drunks. But they always repent whenever

268
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
a travelling preacher comes to town.

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No, I’d say liquor ain’t a regular thing in the home here,

270
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
except as medicine for a cold. Or snake-bite, y ou know.

271
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This has always been like that.

272
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The next question is about social issues and social injustice.

273
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Why doesn't anyone do something about it?

274
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Everybody is,—somethin’ terrible. Seems like they spend

275
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
most of their time talking about who’s rich and who’s poor.

276
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, I dunno. I guess we’re huntin’

277
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
for a way the diligent and sensible can rise to the top

278
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and the lazy and quarrelsome sink to the bottom.

279
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But it ain’t easy to find.

280
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Meantime, we take care of those who can’t help themselves

281
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and those that can we leave alone. Any other questions?

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We have time for one more question. 4th r ow, seat 3.

283
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I s there any culture or love of beauty in—Grover’s Corners?

284
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Well, ma’am, there ain't much—not in the sense you mean. There’s some girls

285
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
that play the piano over at High School Commencement; but they ain’t happy about it.

286
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
There isn’t much culture; but we like the sun cornin’ up

287
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
over the mountain in the morning, and we all notice a good deal about the birds.

288
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And we watch the change of the seasons:

289
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
yes, everybody knows about them. But those other things—

290
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
there ain’t much—Robinson Crusoe and the Bible;

291
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and Händel’s Largo, we all know that; and Whistler’s Mother—

292
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
those are about as far as we go.

293
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Now we’ll go back to town.

294
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's two o’clock.

295
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
All 2642 souls has had their lunches, and all the dishes have been washed.

296
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The children have gone back to school.

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Doc tor Gibbs is in his office, makin’ ’em say “Ah”.

298
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Mr. Webb’s cuttin’ his lawn —

299
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
one man in ten thinks it’s a privilege to push his own lawn-mower.

300
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I can’t, Lois. I’ve got to go help my mother.

301
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I promised her.

302
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Emily, walk simply. Who do you think you are today?

303
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh, Papa, one minute you tell me to stand up straight

304
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and the next minute you call me names. I don’t listen to you.

305
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I've never had such a kiss .

306
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Excuse me, Mrs. Forrest.

307
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You go play in the fields, young man. You got no business playing baseball on Main Street.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Sorry, Mrs. Forrest…

309
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hello, Emily!

310
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
H el lo .

311
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You made a fine speech in class.

312
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well—I was ready to make a speech about the Monroe Doctrine,

313
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
but at the last minute Miss Corcoran made me

314
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
talk about the Louisiana Purchase.

315
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I worked hard on both of them.

316
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Gee, it’s funny, Emily. From my window I can see your head

317
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
nights when you’re doing your home-work in your room.

318
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Why, can you?

319
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You stick to it, Emily. I don’t see how you can sit still that long.

320
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I guess you must like school.

321
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Well, I always feel it’s something you have to go through.

322
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Yeah.

323
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I don’t mind it. Time passes faster in school .

324
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah.

325
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Emily, what do you think? We might work out a kinda telegraph

326
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
from your window to mine;

327
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
once in a while you could give me hint about one of those Algebra problems.

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don’t mean the answers, Emily, just some little hint—

329
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Oh I think hints are allowed. So…

330
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If you get stuck, you whistle and I’ll give you some hints.

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Emily, you’re naturally bright .

332
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I figure it’s just the way a person’s bom.

333
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah. But I want to be a farmer. My Uncle Luke says

334
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
whenever I’m ready I can come work on his farm

335
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
and if I’m any good I can gradually have it.

336
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You mean the house and everything?

337
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Yeah. Well—I better get to the baseball field.

338
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Thanks for the talk, Emily.— Good-afternoon, Mrs. Webb.

339
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
– Good-afternoon, George! – So-long, Emily!

340
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So long, George!

341
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Emily, come help me string these beans.

342
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
George Gibbs let himself have a real conversation, didn’t he?

343
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Why, he's growing up. How old is he?

344
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh, I don’t know.

345
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Let’s see. He must be like sixteen. No more than sevnteen.

346
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Mama, I made a speech in class today and I was very good.

347
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You must recite it to your father at supper. What was it about ?

348
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
The Louisiana Purchase. It was like silk off a spool.

349
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I’m going to make speeches all my life. — Mama, are these big enough ?

350
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Try a little bigger.

351
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Mama, can I ask you something , but serious?

352
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Seriously, dear—not serious.

353
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
– Seriously… will you? – Of course.

354
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Mama, am I pretty ?

355
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Yes, of course. Both my children got good features. I’d be ashamed if they hadn’t.

356
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh, Mama, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is: am I beautiful ?

357
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I’ve already told you, yes. You have a nice young pretty face.

358
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Now that's enough.

359
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, Mama, you never tell us the truth about anything.

360
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I am telling you the truth.

361
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Mama, were you beautiful ?

362
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yes, I was . I f one can say such a thing about oneself.

363
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I was the most beautiful girl in town next to Mamie Cartwright.

364
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But Mama, you’ve got to say something about me.

365
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Am I pretty enough to get people interested in me ?

366
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Emily, you make me tired!

367
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You’re pretty enough for all normal purposes.

368
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Come along and bring that bowl with you.

369
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Oh, Mama, you’re no help.

370
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Now, I think this is a good time to tell you

371
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that the Cartwrights have begun building a new bank in Grover's Corners—

372
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
had to go to Vermont for the marble.

373
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And they've asked a friend of mine what they should put in the cornerstone

374
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
for people to dig up a thousand years from now.

375
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
'Course, they’ve put in a copy of the New York Times

376
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and a copy of Mr. Webb’s Sentinel,

377
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Some scientific fellas have found a way of painting

378
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
all that reading matter with a kind of glue—- silicate glue—

379
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
that'll make it keep a thousand— two thousand years—

380
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
We’ d put in a Bible — a copy of the Constitution of the United States

381
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
and a copy of William Shakespeare’s plays.

382
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What you you think?

383
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Y’ know, Babylon once had two million people in it,

384
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and all we know about them is the names of the kings and some copies

385
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
of wheat contracts and— the sales of slaves.

386
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes, every night all those families sat down to supper,

387
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
and the father came home from work, and the smoke went up the chimney, same as here.

388
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So I’m going to have a copy of this play

389
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
put in the cornerstone so people a thousand years from now’ll know

390
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
about us— more than the Treaty of Versailles

391
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and the Lindbergh flight. you know what I mean?

392
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Well then, people living a thousand years from now :

393
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is the way we were, in our growing up and in our marrying,

394
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and in our living, and in our dying.

395
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Now we’ll get back to Grover's Corners. It’s evening.

396
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You can hear the choir practice in the Congregational Church.

397
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The children are doing their homework.

398
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The day is runnin’ down like a tired clock.

399
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
All right , let ’s start from the beginning.. .

400
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Remember, ladies, music came into the world to give pleasure...

401
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Let’s try it again!

402
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Bles sed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love

403
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
the fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above.

404
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Softer! Softer!

405
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Get it out of your head that music’s only good when it’s loud.

406
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You leave loudness to the Methodists.

407
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You can't beat them at that, even if you wanted to.

408
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now again, tenors!

409
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Blessed be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love ...

410
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
– Emily! – Hello!

411
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I can’t work. The moonlight’s terrible.

412
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
– Emily, did you get the third problem? – Which?

413
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The third.

414
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Why, yes, George— that’s the easiest one.

415
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I don’t see it. Can you give me a hint?

416
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I’ll tell you one thing: the answer’s in yards.

417
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
– In yards? How do you mean? – In square yards.

418
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
– Oh—in square yards. – Yes, don’t you see?

419
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
– Yeah. – In square yards of wallpaper.

420
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, I see. Square yards of wall-paper! Thanks a lot, Emily.

421
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You're welcome , George . My, isn’t the moonlight terrible? And choir practice. ..

422
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If you hold your breath, you can hear the train all the way to Contookuck!

423
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Hear it?

424
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
M-m-m— What do you know!

425
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Well, I guess I better try to learn .

426
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
– Goodnight, Emily. – Goodnight, George.

427
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That’s better. But not good.

428
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Before I forget:

429
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
How many of you can sing at Fred Hersey’s wedding on Tuesday?

430
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Put your hands up.

431
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
We'll play sing what we sang three weeks ago at the wedding of Jane Trowbridge.

432
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
"Art thou weary, art thou languid?" It’s a question. Make it talk.

433
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
– Oh, George, can you come down ? – Yes, Pa.

434
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And remember Sunday to take the second verse real soft at the end.

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Ready?

436
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Make yourself comfortable. I’ll only keep you a minute. George, how old are you?

437
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Me? I'm sixteen, almost seventeen.

438
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What do you want to do after school’s over?

439
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I want to be a farmer on Uncle Luke’s farm.

440
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You’ll be willing to get up early and milk and feed the stock—

441
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and you’ll hoe and hay all day ?

442
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Sure, I will. What do you mean, Pa?

443
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well, George, while I was in my office today

444
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I heard a funny sound:

445
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
a nd what do you think , what was it?

446
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Your mother chopping wood.

447
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
There you see your mother— up early;

448
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
cooking meals all day; washing and ironing;—

449
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
and still she has to chop wood,

450
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I guess she got tired of asking you.

451
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
She decided it was easier to do it herself.

452
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And you eat her meals, and put on the clothes she washes,

453
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and you run off and play baseball,—

454
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
like she’s some hired girl we don’t really love, but we keep around the house .

455
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Well, I wanted to let you know. Here's a handkerchief, son.

456
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I’ve decided to raise your spending money , George.

457
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
25 cents a week.

458
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Not for chopping wood, because that’s a present you give your mother,

459
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
but because you’re getting older—

460
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I imagine there are things you need it for now.

461
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Thanks, Pa.

462
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Let’s see— tomorrow’s pay day.

463
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Probably Rebecca’ll feel she ought to have some more too.

464
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Wonder what could have happened to your mother.

465
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Choir practice never was as late as this before.

466
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's only half-past eight, Pa.

467
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I don’t know why she's in that choir anyway. She sounds like an old crow!

468
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And traipsin’ around at this hour of the night! About time you retired, don’t you think?

469
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, Pa.

470
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
– Goodnight, Martha. – Goodnight, Mr. Foster.

471
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I’ll tell Mr. Webb; I know he’ll want to put it in the paper.

472
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
My, it’s late!

473
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Goodnight, Irma.

474
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
– Real nice choir practice, wasn’t it? – Um-m!

475
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Myrtle Webb! Look at that moon!

476
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Good potato-growing weather is coming, that’s for sure!

477
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Well, I didn't want to say it in front of those others but now we’re alone—,

478
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
it’s the worst scandal ever in this town!

479
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
– What? – Simon Stimson!

480
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Now, Louella!

481
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But, Julia! The organist of a church, drunk year after year.

482
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You saw he was drunk tonight.

483
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You know he was drunk tonight.

484
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Louella! We all know about Mr. Stimson, and we all know about his troubles,

485
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and Doctor Ferguson knows too. A nd if Reverend Ferguson keeps him, it means

486
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
th e only thing the rest of us can do is just not to notice it.

487
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Not to notice it! But it’s getting worse.

488
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
No, it isn’t, Louella.

489
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I’ve been in that choir twice as long as you. It doesn’t happen anywhere near so often.

490
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Louella, look at that beautiful moon!

491
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Those children will be up all night. Goodnight, Louella.

492
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Goodnight, Myrtle. Can you get home safe, Louella?

493
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Oh, it’s bright as day. I can see my husband scowling at the windows now.

494
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You’d think we’d been to a dance the way the men folk carry on. Goodnight, Julia.

495
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Goodnight, Louella.

496
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
– See you on Sunday. – See you then !

497
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, we had a real good time.

498
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You’re late enough.

499
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Why, Frank, it ain’t any later than usual.

500
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And you stopping to gossip with a lot of hens.

501
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Don’t be grouchy.

502
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Come smell my heliotrope in the moonlight.

503
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Isn’t that wonderful? What did you do tonight?

504
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh, I read—What were the girls gossiping about tonight?

505
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
– Well, there’s something to gossip about. – Simon Stimson far gone, was he?

506
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Worst I've seen him. How’ll that end, Frank?

507
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Reverend Ferguson can’t forgive him forever.

508
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I guess I know more about Simon Stimson’s affairs than anybody in this town.

509
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Some people ain’t made for small town life.

510
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don’t know how that’ll end; but there’s nothing we can do — Get in.

511
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
No, not yet. —Frank, I'm worried about you.

512
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
What are you worried about ?

513
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I think you need a real rest

514
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
and change.

515
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
If I get that inheritance. I’m going to insist on it.

516
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Now, Julia, not that again.

517
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Frank, you’re unreasonable!

518
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Come on, Julia, it’s late. You’ll catch cold—

519
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I gave George a piece of my mind tonight. I’m sure that from now on

520
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You'll have your wood chopped, for a while anyway. No, no.

521
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh dear, there’s always so many things to pick up.

522
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
You know, Frank, Mrs. Grover always locks her front door.

523
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
All those people that part of town do.

524
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
They’re all gettin’ citified. They haven't got anythin’ fit to steal..

525
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Get out, Rebecca. There’s only room for one here.

526
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Well, let me look just a minute.

527
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Use your own window.

528
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
There's no moon there ...

529
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
George, do you know what I think?

530
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I think maybe the moon’s getting nearer and nearer

531
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and there’ll be a big explosio n!

532
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
You have no idea, Rebecca . If the moon were getting nearer,

533
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the men that sit up all night with telescopes would see it

534
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and it’d be in all the newspapers.

535
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
George, is the moon shining on South America, Canada

536
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
and half the whole world?

537
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Well—probably is.

538
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Nine-thirty.

539
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Most lights in town are out.

540
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There's Constable Warren trying a few doors on Main Street.

541
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Here comes Editor Webb, after putting his newspaper to bed.

542
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
– Good evening. Bill. – Evenin’, Mr. Webb.

543
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
– Quite a moon! – Yeh!

544
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
All quiet tonight?

545
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Simon Stimson is rollin’ around a little. Just saw his wife out

546
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
looking for him so I looked the other way— there he is now.

547
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Good evening, Simon !

548
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Town seems to have settled down for the night.

549
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes, most of the people in town have gone home, Simon.

550
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I guess we better do the same.

551
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Can I walk along with you?

552
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Good night.

553
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I don’t know how that’s goin’ to end, Mr. Webb.

554
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, he's been trouble ...

555
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Oh, Bill , if you see my boy smoking,

556
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
give him a word? He thinks a lot of you.

557
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I don’t think he smokes, Mr.Webb, not more than two or three cigarettes a year.

558
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Hm. I hope not. Good night, Bill.

559
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Good night, Mr. Webb.

560
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
– Who’s that? Is that you Myrtle? – No, it’s me, Papa.

561
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Why aren’t you in bed?

562
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don’t know. I can’t sleep, Papa. The moonlight’s wonderful.

563
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And Mrs. Gibbs’s heliotropes. Can you smell it?

564
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Hm—Yes. No troubles on your mind, Emily?

565
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Troubles, Papa. No !

566
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Well, don’t let your mother catch you. Good night, Emily.

567
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Good night , Papa.

568
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I never told you about that letter Jane Crofut got from her minister

569
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
when she was sick.

570
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The address on the envelope said:

571
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Jane Crofut; The Crofut Farm, Grover’s Corners; Sutton County;

572
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
New Hampshire; United States of America.

573
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
What’s funny about that?

574
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Listen, it’s not finished: the United States of America; Continent of North America;

575
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Western Hemisphere; the Earth; the Solar System;

576
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
the Mind of God.

577
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What do you know!

578
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
– Yep, and the postman delivered it. – What do you know!

579
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That’s the end of the First Act.

580
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
T hree years have gone by.

581
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yes, the sun has risen a thousan d times.

582
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Summers and winters have cracked the mountains more and the rains

583
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
brought down some of the dirt.

584
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Some babies that weren’t even born before, have begun talkin’ sentences;

585
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
and a number of people who thought they were young have noticed

586
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
that they can’t bound up a flight of stairs like they used to.

587
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
All that can happen in a thousand days.

588
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Nature’s been pushin’ in other ways, too—

589
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
a number of young people fell in love.

590
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The First Act was called The Daily Life ; this Act is called Love and Marriage .

591
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Almost everybody in the world gets married— know what I mean?

592
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
In our town there aren’t many exceptions.

593
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Most everybody climbs into their grave married.

594
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So; three years later. 1904. July 7th,

595
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
just after High School Commencement.

596
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That’s when our young people jump up and get married.

597
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Soon as they’ve passed their last examinations, looks like they feel themselves fit to get married

598
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and Cicero's words, it would seem that they consider themselves marriageable.

599
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It’s early morning. Only this time it’s been raining.

600
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
It was absolutely pouring down with thunderstorms.

601
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Mrs. Gibbs’s garden— and Mrs. Webb’s here—drenched.

602
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
A lot of bean stems and pea pods are full of water.

603
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
All yesterday, over on Main Street the rain looked like curtains being blown along.

604
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Hear it? Hm—don't know now— may begin again any minute.

605
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
There’s the 5 0.45 train for Boston.

606
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And there’s Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb

607
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
making breakfast, as if this were an ordinary day.

608
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I don’t have to point out to the women in the audience

609
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
that both these ladies cooked three meals a day,

610
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
one of ’em for twenty years and the other for forty—

611
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
no summer vacation.

612
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
They raised two children apiece, washed, cleaned the house,

613
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and never had a nervous breakdown.

614
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Never thought themselves hard-used, either — It’s like what one of those poets said:

615
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
‘’You got to love life to have life, and you got to have life to love life—’’

616
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Do you know who said that?

617
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Thornton Wilder, the author of this play. As the saying goes – it’s a vicious circle.

618
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
There comes Howie Newsome and Bessie, deliverin’ the milk.

619
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Giddy up, Bessie!

620
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And there’s Si Crowell deliverin’ the papers like his brother.

621
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Good morning, Howie .

622
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Good morning, Si. Anythin’ in the papers I ought to know.

623
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Nothin’ much, we’re losin’ about the best baseball pitcher

624
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
– George Gibbs – Grover’s Corners ever had.

625
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Aya, reckon he is.

626
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Now all he’ll be doin’ is pitchin’ hay.

627
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Whoa, Bessie! Guess I can stop and talk.

628
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
– George could hit, too. And run bases. – Fine ballplayer.

629
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don’t see how he could give that up  to get married.

630
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Would you, Howie?

631
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Can’t tell. Si. Never had that talent.

632
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Mornin’, Howie!

633
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Good morning , Bill. You’re up early.

634
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Seein’ if there’s anything I can do to prevent a flood.

635
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
River’s been risin’ all night.

636
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Si Crowell here’s upset George Gibbs is retiring from baseball.

637
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That’s how it goes. In '84 we had a player, far better than George Gibbs. .

638
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
His name was Hank Todd.

639
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Hank Todd! In '84 we had a player whose name was that.

640
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
He went to Maine and become a parson.

641
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Wonderful ballplayer.

642
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Howie, how's the weather?

643
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Not bad. Think maybe it’ll clear up for good.

644
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
– Goo morning, Mrs. Gibbs. – Good morning, Howie.

645
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Too bad about the weather. It’s been raining so heavy that maybe it’ll clear up.

646
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
– Certainly hope it will. – How much did you want today?

647
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Looks like I’ll need three-a-milk and two-a-cream.

648
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Three a milk and two a cream.

649
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
My wife says to tell you, mrs. Gibbs,

650
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
we hope they’ll be happy. And I’m sure they will.

651
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Thanks, Howie. Tell your wife I hope she gets to the wedding.

652
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
She will if she can .

653
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Good morning, M rs. Webb.

654
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, good morning, Mr. Newsome. I told you four quarts,

655
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
but I hope you can spare another.

656
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Yes , madam… and two-a-cream.

657
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Will it start raining again, Howie?

658
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Well— I was just telling Mrs. Gibbs it may clear up.

659
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
My wife told me to tell you as how we hope

660
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
they’ll be happy, M’s Webb,—know they will.

661
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Thank you, and thank Mrs. Newsome , we’re counting on seeing you at the church.

662
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yes, Mrs Webb. We hope to be there Come on, Bessie!

663
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Well, Ma. You’re losing one of your chicks.

664
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Yes.

665
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Frank Gibbs, don’t you say another word.

666
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Sit down and drink your coffee.

667
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The groom’s shaving, only there ain’t much to shave—

668
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
whistling like he's glad to leave us.—

669
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Every now and then he says “I do” to the mirror, but it don't sound convincing to me.

670
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Really, Frank, I don’t know how he’ll get along. I’ve arranged his clothes,

671
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
kept his feet and warm things on—

672
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Frank, they’re too young! Emily won’t think of such things.

673
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
He’ll catch his death-a-cold within a week.

674
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I remember my wedding morning.

675
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Now don't start, Frank.

676
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I was the searedest young fella in New Hampshire.

677
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I thought I'd made a mistake.

678
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
When I saw you coming down that aisle

679
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I thought you were the prettiest girl I’d seen;

680
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
the only trouble was that I’d never seen you before.

681
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I was in the Congregational Church marryin’ a total stranger!

682
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And how do you think I felt? Frank, w eddings are awful things.

683
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Farces! Here, I made you something.

684
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Why, Julia! French toast!

685
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I had to do something.

686
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
– How’d you sleep, Julia? – Well, I heard the clock every hour.

687
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yes!

688
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Aya, I get a shock every time I think of George

689
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
setting out to be a family man!

690
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
There’s nothing so terrifying in the world as a son.

691
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The relation of father and son is the damndest, —

692
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Well, mother and daughter’s no picnic—

693
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
They’ll have troubles, but that’s none of our business.

694
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Everybody has a right to their own troubles.

695
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Aya… people are meant to live two-by-two in this world. It’s not good to be all by yourself.

696
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Julia, do you know one of the things I was scared of when I married you?

697
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I was afraid we didn’t have enough to talk about for more than  a few weeks.

698
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
that we’d eat our meals in silence.

699
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Well, you and I been conversing for twenty years without

700
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
any barren spells.

701
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, good weather, bad weather, I always find something to say.

702
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Did you hear Rebecca up yet?

703
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
No. Only day of the year Rebecca hasn’t been managing everybody’s business.

704
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
She’s hiding, might be crying.

705
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Lord’s sakes— this has got to stop.

706
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Rebecca! Come get breakfast.

707
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Good morning. Only four more hours to live!

708
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
– Where are you going? – To see my bride .

709
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Now, George, put on your boots . It’s raining torrents.

710
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You don’t go out of this house without being prepared.

711
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Aw, Ma—it’s just a step.

712
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You’ll catch your death-a-cold through the service.

713
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
George, do what your mother says!

714
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
From tomorrow on you can go wherever and whenever you want,

715
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
While you’re in my house you’ll live wisely .

716
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Perhaps Mrs. Webb isn’t used to callers this early.

717
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Here, take a cup of coffee.

718
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Just a sec.

719
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Good morning, Mother Webb.

720
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh my God! You frightened me! B ut you know I can’t ask you in.

721
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Why not—?

722
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Why, George, the groom can’t see

723
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
his bride on his wedding day.

724
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Aw,—that’s  superstition. Good morning, Mr. Webb.

725
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Good morning, George.

726
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Mr. Webb, you don’t believe in that, do you?

727
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
There’s common-sense in superstitions, George.

728
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Millions have followed it, George,

729
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and don’t be the first to fly in the face of custom.

730
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
How is Emily?

731
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
She hasn't waked up yet.

732
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Emily’s asleep?

733
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
No wonder! We were up all night sewing and packing.

734
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Now, George; you sit with Mr. Webb and drink this cup of coffee;

735
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I’ll run upstairs and make sure Emily doesn’t come downstairs.

736
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There's bacon, too. But don’t stay long.

737
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Well, George, how are you?

738
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm fine. Mr. Webb, what commonsense could there be in a superstition like that?

739
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Well, on the wedding morning a girl’s head's full of clothes and—

740
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
one thing and another.

741
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That’s probably it?

742
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I never thought of that.

743
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
A girl's nervous on her wedding day.

744
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Gee, I wish a person could get married without all that marching.

745
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Every man that’s ever lived has felt that way, George, but it was no use.

746
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
It’s the women who’ve built up weddings.

747
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
For a while now the women have it all their own.

748
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
A man looks pretty small at a wedding, George.

749
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
All those women making sure the knot’s tied

750
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
in a public way.

751
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Well, you believe in it, don’t you, Mr. Webb?

752
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yes. Oh, yes! Now, don’t get me wrong, boy,

753
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
marriage is a wonderful thing. Don’t forget that, George.

754
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
No, sir. Mr. Webb, how old were you when you got married?

755
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Well, I'd been to college and taken a little time to get settled.

756
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But my wife wasn’t much older than Emily.

757
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Oh, age hasn’t got much to do with it, George, compared with—

758
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
other things.

759
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
What were you going to say, Mr. Webb?

760
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Ah, I don’t know… Was I going to say something?

761
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I was remembering the other night what my father said

762
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
when I got married.

763
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Charles, he said: start right off showin ’ who’s boss.

764
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Best thing to do is to give an order, just so she’ll learn to obey,

765
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Then he said: “If anything about her irritates you,

766
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
the tone of her voice, or something else, get right up and leave the house;

767
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
that’ll make it clear to her.” And he said: "Never let your wife know

768
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
how much money you have, never.”

769
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Well…

770
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So I took the opposite of his advice

771
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and I’ve been happy ever since. So let that be a lesson to you , George ,

772
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
never to ask advice on personal matters ...

773
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
... are you going to raise chickens?

774
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
– What? – Are you raising chickens on your farm?

775
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
A book came in on the Philo System of raising chickens.

776
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I wish you’d read it. I’m thinking of beginning myself,

777
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
in the back yard! I’m going to put an incubator in the cellar—

778
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Charles Webb, are you talking about that incubator again?

779
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I thought you were talking about serious things.

780
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Well, Myrtle, if you want to give the boy some advice,

781
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I’ll go upstairs and leave you alone with him.

782
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
George, Emily’s got to eat breakfast!

783
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
She sends you her love, but doesn’t want to see you. Goodbye, George.

784
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Myrtle, guess you didn’t know about that older superstition.

785
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Since the caveman. No bridegroom should see

786
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
his father-in-law the day of the wedding.

787
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Or a day close to it. Remember that.

788
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I have to interrupt again. You see, we want to know how all this began.

789
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The wedding… the plan for two people to spend their whole lives together.

790
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm terribly interested in how big things like this start.

791
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You know how it is: you’re 21 or 22 and you make some decisions;

792
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
then whisssh– you’re 70; you’ve been a lawyer for 50 years,

793
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and that white-haired lady by your side

794
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
has eaten over fifty thousand meals with you.

795
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
How do such things begin?

796
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
George and Emily will show you the conversation they had

797
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
when they first knew

798
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
”they were meant for one another”.

799
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Before they do I want you to remember

800
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
when you were very young,

801
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
the days when you were first in love;

802
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
when you were like a person sleep-walking.

803
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
You didn’t hear a thing they said to you.

804
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You’re a little bit crazy. Will you remember that, please?

805
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It ’s three o’clock. Now they’ll be coming out of High School .

806
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
George has just been elected President of the Senior Class ; since it's June,

807
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
that means he will be the senior class president next year.

808
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And Emily’s just been elected Secretary and Treasurer.

809
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Aya, they’re coming down Main Street now.

810
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I can't, Louise, I gotta go home.

811
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Goodbye. Oh, Ernestine!

812
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Can you come over tonight and do Latin ?—

813
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Isn’t Cicero the worst thing?— Well, tell your mother you have to.

814
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Bye , Helen, bye, Fred.

815
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Emily, can I carry your books home?

816
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Why—uh—thank you. It isn’t far.

817
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
’Scuse me, Emily, will you?— Say, Bob, if I’m a little late,

818
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
start practice, and give Herb some long high ones.

819
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Bye , Lizzie.

820
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Hello , Lizzy .

821
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I’m glad you were elected too, Emily.

822
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Thank you.

823
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
– Emily, why are you mad at me? – I’m not mad at you.

824
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
You’ve been treating me so funny lately.

825
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Well, since you ask, I might as well say it , George—

826
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Oh, goodbye. Miss Corcoran.

827
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Goodbye, Miss Corcoran.—

828
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
What is it?

829
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I don’t like the whole change that’s come over you in the last year.

830
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Change?

831
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I’m sorry if that hurts your feelings but I have to tell you the truth.

832
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Wha-what do you mean?

833
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Well, up to a year ago, I used to like you a lot. I used to watch you —

834
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
because we’d been friends so long.

835
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And then you began spending all your time at baseball.

836
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And you never stopped to speak to anybody anymore not even to your own family, you didn’t.

837
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
George, ever since you’ve been elected Captain, you’ve got stuck up

838
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
and conceited. All the girls say so.

839
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And it hurts to hear 'em say it;

840
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
but I agree with ’em because it's true.

841
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Gosh, Emily. I guess it’s hard for a fella not to have

842
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
some faults creep into his character.

843
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I always expect a man to be perfect. He has to be like that.

844
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Oh, I—I don’t think it’s possible to be perfect, Emily.

845
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Well, my father is. And as far as I can see, your father is.

846
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
No excuse why you shouldn’t be, too.

847
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Well, I feel it’s the other way round;

848
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
men aren’t naturally good, but girls are.

849
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Well, I’m not perfect.— It’s not as easy for a girl to be perfect

850
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
as a man, because we girls are more … nervous ...

851
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Now I’m sorry I said all that about you, George. .

852
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I don't know what made me say it.

853
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Now I can see it’s not the truth.

854
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It’s not important, anyway.

855
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Emily—would you like an ice-cream soda before you go home?

856
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Well, thank you , I would.

857
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Hello, Stew, how are you? Good afternoon, Mrs. Slocum.

858
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Hello, George. Hello Emily. What’ll you have?—

859
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Why, Emily Webb, what you been cry in’ about?

860
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
She got an awful scare, Mr. Morgan.

861
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
That—that hardware-store wagon almost ran over her.

862
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Tom Huckins drives like a crazy man.

863
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
D rink some water, Emily. You look very distracted.

864
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You got to look both ways before you cross Main Street these days.

865
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Gets worse every year— What’ll you have?

866
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I’ll have a lemonade , thank you, Mr. Morgan !

867
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
No, no, Emily—have an ice-cream with me.

868
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Two strawberry and chocolate ice-cream, Mr. Morgan.

869
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Two strawberry and chocolate ice-cream , yes sir.

870
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
There are 1 25 horses in Grover’s Corners this minute I’m talking to you.

871
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
State Inspector was here yesterday.

872
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And now they’re bringing in these auto-mo-biles,

873
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
best thing to do is just stay home.

874
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Why I can remember when dogs used to sleep

875
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
in the middle of the street, and nothing ever come to disturb them.

876
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
There you are! Mrs. Ellis, be with you in a minute.

877
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
They’re so expensive.

878
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
No, no—don’t think of that, Emily. We’re celebrating—our election—

879
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And then do you know what else I'm celebrating?

880
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I’m celebrating because I've got a friend who tells me what ought to be told me.

881
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
George, don’t think of that.

882
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I don't know why I said it. It’s not true. You’re—

883
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
No, Emily, I’m glad you spoke to me like you did.

884
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
But I’m going to change so quick. You can count on that.

885
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And Emily, I want to ask you a favor.

886
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
W-wh-a-t?

887
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I f I go away to State Agriculture College next year,

888
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
will you write me a letter once in a while?

889
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I certainly will, George—

890
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It seems like being away three years

891
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
you’d get out of touch with things.

892
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Maybe Grover’s Corners won’t be so interesting after a while.

893
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Grover’s Corners isn’t a very important place when you think of—

894
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
all New Hampshire; but I think it’s a very nice town.

895
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
The day wouldn’t come when I wouldn’t want to know

896
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
everything about our town. I know this is true, Emily.

897
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Well, I’ll try to make the letters interesting.

898
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Emily, whenever I meet a farmer I ask him if he thinks

899
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
it's important to go to Agriculture School to be a good farmer.

900
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Yeh, and some of them say it’s even a waste of time.

901
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
You can get all that stuff, anyway,

902
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
in the pamphlets the Government sends out— Uncle Luke’s gettin’ old,—

903
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
he’s about ready for me to take over his farm.

904
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
My!

905
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
And like you say, being gone all that time—

906
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
in other places and meeting other people— I guess new people

907
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
probably aren’t any better than old ones.

908
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I feel that you’re as good a friend as I’ve got.

909
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I don’t need to go and meet new ones.

910
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
But George, maybe it’s important for you

911
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
to go and learn all that cattle-judging and soils and those things.

912
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Of course, I don’t know.

913
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Emily I’m going to make up my mind right now—I won’t go. Tonight I’ll tell my father.

914
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Why George. I don’t see why you have to decide right now—

915
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It’s a whole year away.

916
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Emily, I’m glad you spoke to me about that—

917
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
that fault in my character but there was one thing wrong.

918
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
namely that for a year now I didn't pay attention to anyone, and...

919
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You, for example. You say you were watchin’ me when I did everything—

920
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Why, I was doing the same about you.

921
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I always thought about you as one of the chief people I thought about.

922
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I always made sure where you were  sitting on the bleachers. And we talked a lot in school

923
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
and that was really important to me.

924
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Of course it wasn’t as good as the conversation we’re having right now.

925
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Then, lately, I started to observe that you act a bit strange with me.

926
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
And for three months not I’ve tried to walk home with you; but something's always got in the way.

927
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Yesterday, I was waiting for you, and you walked home with Miss Corcoran.

928
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Oh, George!— Life’s awful funny! How could I have known that?

929
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I thought—

930
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Listen, Emily, I’m going to tell you why I’m not going to Agricultural School.

931
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I think once you’ve found a person you’re very fond of—

932
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and fond of you, enough to be interested in your character—

933
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Well, I think that’s just as important as college is,

934
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
even more so. That ’s my opinion.

935
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I think that’s awfully important, too.

936
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
– Emily— – Y—yes, George.

937
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Emily, if I make a big change: could you be—

938
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I—I am now ... and always have been ...

939
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So I guess—this is an important talk we've been having—

940
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes , yes.

941
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Wait a second . Then I ’ll walk you home.

942
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Mr. Morgan, I’ll— I’ll have to go home and get the money.

943
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
What’s that? George Gibbs, do you mean to tell me—

944
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Yes. But I had important motivations, Mr . Morgan.

945
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Look—here’s my gold watch to keep until I come back.

946
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
That’s all right. Keep your watch. I’ll trust you.

947
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I’ll be back in five minutes.

948
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I’ll trust you ten years, George — not a day over.—

949
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Got all over your shock, Emily?

950
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morgan— it was nothing.

951
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I’m ready to go .

952
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Well, now we’ll get on to the wedding.

953
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
There are a lot of things to be said about a wedding,

954
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
and during the wedding there can be a lot to think about.

955
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
We can’t get them all into one wedding, naturally,—

956
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
especially not in Grover’s Corners,

957
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
where weddings are mighty short and plain.

958
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
In this play I take the part of the minister.

959
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That gives me the right to say a few things more.

960
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Yes, for a while now the play gets pretty serious.

961
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Y'see,—some churches say that marriage is a sacrament.

962
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I don't know what that means exactly, but I have my suspicions.

963
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
People are supposed to live two-by-two – li ke Mrs. Gibbs said a few minutes ago .

964
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
A wedding is a god thing. But even during such a joyful occasion,

965
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
many doubts quietly creep into the heart.

966
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Has the moment truly come for me to take this important step?

967
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Is this person beside me really the one and only

968
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
whom God and fate have destined for me?

969
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Like one of those European fellas said: Every time a child is born into the world

970
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
it’s Nature’s attempt to make a perfect human being.

971
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Well, we’ve seen Nature pushing and contriving for some time now.

972
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
We know she’s interested in quantity; but I think she’s interested in quality, too.

973
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Maybe she's tryin’ to make another good Governor for New Hampshire.

974
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
That’s what Emily hopes.

975
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And don't forget the other witnesses, the ancestors.

976
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Millions of them. Most of them set out to live two-by-two.

977
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Hope. T hat’s all my sermon. Twan’t very long anyway.

978
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I don’t know why I’m crying. I guess I have no reason to cry.

979
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
This morning at breakfast it came over me. There was Emily eating breakfast

980
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
as she’s done for 17 years—

981
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
And now she’s going to eat in someone else's house in the morning.

982
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I suppose that’s it— And Emily suddenly said: ‘’ I can’t eat another mouthful.’’

983
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And she put her head on the table and she cried.

984
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
T here’s something downright cruel about sending girls

985
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
out into marriages.

986
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I hope she heard something from one of her friends.

987
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It’s—it’s cruel, I know; but I just couldn’t get myself to say anything …

988
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I went into it as blind as a bat myself.

989
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
The whole world’s wrong, that’s what’s the matter.

990
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Eh, George!

991
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Look at him, fellas. He’s scared to death!

992
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
George! You don’t have to look so innocent, you old geezer.

993
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We know what you’re thinking. Go to it, big boy, y’ old geezer you.

994
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
All right! That’s enough of that.

995
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
There used to be an awful lot of that kind of thing in weddings in the old days

996
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
We’re more civilized now,—so they say.

997
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
George! What’s the matter?

998
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Ma, I don’t want to grow old! Why’s everybody pushing me so?

999
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
– Why, George—you wanted it. – No, Ma, listen to me—

1000
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
No, no, George—you’re a man now I

1001
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Listen, Ma—for the last time I ask you. All I want to do is to be a fella—

1002
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
George! If anyone should hear you! Why, I’m ashamed of you!

1003
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
What? Where’s Emily?

1004
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
George, you gave me such a fright.

1005
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Cheer up, Ma. I’m getting married.

1006
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Let me catch my breath.

1007
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Ma, you save Thursday nights

1008
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Emily and I are coming over to dinner every Thursday night.

1009
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Why, Ma.What are you crying for? Come on. We got to get ready.

1010
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I never felt so alone in my whole life.

1011
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And George, over there—I hate him— I wish I were dead. Papa! Papa!

1012
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
– Emily! Now don’t get upset— – But, Papa,—I don’t want to get married—

1013
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Sh-h—Emily—Everything’s all right.

1014
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Why can’t I stay for a while just as I am? Let’s go away—

1015
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
No, no,— Now think a minute.

1016
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Don't you remember what you used to say—that I was your girl.

1017
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
There must be lots of places we can go to.

1018
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I'd work for you. I could keep house.

1019
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Sh! You musn't think of such things. You're just nervous, Emily.

1020
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
George! George! Will you come here a minute!

1021
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Why, you're marrying the best young fellow in the world. George is a great boy.

1022
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I’m giving away my daughter, George. Can you take care of her?

1023
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I want to— I ’ll try. Emily, I'm going to do my best.

1024
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I love you. I need you.

1025
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Well, if you love me, help me— all I want is someone to love me.

1026
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I will, Emily, I'll try.

1027
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And I mean forever. Do you hear? Forever.

1028
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Come, they're waiting for us. Now, you know it’ll be all right.

1029
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Doesn’t she make a lovely bride?

1030
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Do you, George, take this woman, Emily, to be your wedded wife,

1031
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
to have and to hold from this day forward,

1032
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
in sickness and in health, for richer for poorer,

1033
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
to love and to cherish till death do us part?

1034
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Loveliest wedding I ever saw.

1035
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I really like lovely weddings. Doesn’t she make a lovely bride?

1036
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yes.

1037
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Do you, Emily, take this man, George, to be your wedded husband?

1038
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Don’t know when I’ve seen such a lovely wedding.

1039
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
But I always cry. I just like to see young people happy.

1040
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Don’t you? Oh, I think it’s lovely!

1041
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
…till death do you part?

1042
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I do!

1043
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
The ring!

1044
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I’ve married two hundred couples.

1045
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Do I believe in it? I don’t know. I suppose so. X marries Y.. .

1046
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The cottage, the go-cart, the Sunday afternoon drives with the Ford —

1047
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
the first rheumatism—the grandchildren— the second rheumatism—the deathbed—

1048
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
the reading of the will— Once in a thousand times it’s interesting.

1049
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Let’s hear it!

1050
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Aren’t they a lovely couple?

1051
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I’ve never been on such a lovely wedding.

1052
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I'm sure they'll be happy. I always say: happiness!

1053
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
This is the most important thing in life! The important thing is to be happy.

1054
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
That’s the second act . Let ’s go breath in some fresh air.

1055
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
This time nine years have gone by, friends— summer, 19 1 3

1056
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Gradual changes have taken place in Grover's Corners.

1057
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Horses are gettin’ rarer. Farmers coming into town now in Fords.

1058
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Everybody locks their house doors at night. Ain't been any burglars in town yet,

1059
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
but everybody’s heard about ’em.

1060
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
You’d be surprised though—on the whole, things don’t change much i n Grover ’s Corners .

1061
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
This is certainly an important part of our town.

1062
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It’s on a hilltop—lots of sky, lots of clouds,—

1063
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
often lots of sun and moon and stars.

1064
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I often wonder why people like to be buried in Woodlawn and Brooklyn .

1065
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
when they might pass the same time her e .

1066
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Over here are the old stones : 16 7 , 16 8

1067
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Strong- minded people that come a long ways to be independent

1068
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Summer people walk around there laughing

1069
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
at the funny words on the tombstones.

1070
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Over there—are some Civil War veterans. —

1071
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Iron pennants are on their tombstones.

1072
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Had a notion that the Union ought to be kept together,

1073
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
though they’d never seen more than fifty miles of it themselves.

1074
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,000
All they knew was the name : the United States of America.

1075
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And they went and died about it.

1076
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This here is the new part of the cemetery.

1077
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
There’s your friend, Mrs. Gibbs.

1078
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And here's Mr. Stimson, the Congregational Church organist.

1079
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And Mrs. Soames who enjoyed the weddin' so much, remember?

1080
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Oh, and a lot of others. Wall y , whose appendix burst

1081
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
while he was on a Boy Scout trip in Crawford Notch .

1082
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Mr. Carter, Mrs. Grover, the Cartwright family...

1083
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yes, an awful lot of sorrow here.

1084
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
People wild with grief have brought their relatives up to this hill ,

1085
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
—-and then times—sunny days—

1086
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
rainy days— snow— You know how it is.

1087
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
A lot of thoughts come up here, night and day, but no post office—

1088
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
We all know that something is eternal And it ain’t houses or names,

1089
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and it ain’t earth, and it ain’t even the stars ...

1090
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
everybody knows in their bones that something is eternal ,

1091
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
and th at something has to do with human beings .

1092
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
All the greatest people ever lived have been telling us that for five thousand years .

1093
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
and yet you’d be surprised how people are always letting go of that fact.

1094
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
There’s something way down deep that’s eternal about every human being.

1095
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Y’know, the dead don’t stay interested in us living people for very long.

1096
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Gradually, they let go hold of the earth—

1097
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
and their ambitions their pleasures —

1098
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
and the people they loved.

1099
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
They get weaned away from earth , like a weaned infant from its mother's breast.

1100
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yes, they stay here while the earth-part of ’em burns away,

1101
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
and all that time they slowly get indifferent to what’s goin’ on in Grover’s Corners.

1102
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
They’re waitin' for something they feel is cornin’.

1103
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Aren’t they waitin’ for the eternal part in them to come out—clear?

1104
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Some of the things they’re going to say maybe’ll hurt your feelings—

1105
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
but that’s the way it is: mother 'n daughter —husband ’n wife—enemy ‘n enemy—

1106
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
money ‘n miser— all those important things grow pale around here.

1107
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
And what's left? What’s left when memory’s gone?

1108
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Well, here are some living people.

1109
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
There’s Joe Stoddard, our undertaker .

1110
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And here comes Sam Craig, a Grover’s Corners boy that left town to go out West

1111
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Good afternoon, Joe Stoddard

1112
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Good afternoon , good afternoon . Let me see now: do I know you?

1113
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I’m Sam Craig.

1114
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I should have know n you’d be back for the funeral.

1115
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You’ve been away a long time, Sam.

1116
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Yes, over twelve years. I’m in business in Buffalo now, Joe—

1117
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
But I was in the East when I got news of my cousin’s death, so I thought

1118
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I’d come back and see the old home— You look well.

1119
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yes, yes, can’t complain— Very sad, our journey today, Samuel.

1120
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yes.

1121
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yes, yes. I always say, I hate to supervise

1122
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
when a young person is taken. They’ll be here in a few minutes now.

1123
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I had to come here early today— my son’s supervisin' at the home ...

1124
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Old Farmer McCarthy! I used to do chores for him after school.

1125
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
He had lumbago.

1126
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yes, we brought Farmer McCarthy here a number of years ago now.

1127
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Why, this is my Aunt Julia— I’d forgotten that she’d—of course!

1128
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Yes, D r. Gibbs lost his wife two-three years ago—about this time.

1129
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Today’s another bad blow for him. ..

1130
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
That’s my sister Carrie’s boy Sam—Sam Craig.

1131
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I’m always uncomfortable when they’re around.

1132
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Do they choose their own verses much, Joe?

1133
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
No—not usual. Mostly the leftovers pick a verse.

1134
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Doesn't sound like Aunt Julia.

1135
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Well, there aren’t many of those Hersey sisters left now.

1136
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I wanted to look at my father’s and mother’s—

1137
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Over there with the Craigs, Avenue F.

1138
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Simon Stimson... He was organist at church, wasn’t he? Drank a lot , we used to say.

1139
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Nobody was supposed to know about it. He's been through a lot of trouble.

1140
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Took his own life .

1141
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Oh, did he?

1142
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Hung himself in the attic. They tried to hash it up, but of course it got around.

1143
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Chose his own epitaph. It ain’t a verse exactly.

1144
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Why, it’s just some notes of music— what is it?

1145
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Oh, I wouldn’t know. It was wrote up in the Boston papers at the time.

1146
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
– W hat did she die of? – Who?

1147
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
My cousin.

1148
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Had some trouble bringing a baby into the world. ’Was her second, though.

1149
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
There's a little boy ’bout four years old.

1150
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And th is is her grave ?

1151
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Yes, there ain’t much more room over here among the Gibbses,

1152
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
so they’re opening up a whole new Gibbs section over by Avenue B.

1153
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
You’ll excuse me now. I see they’re cornin’.

1154
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
– Who is it, Julia? – My daughter-in-law, Emily Webb.

1155
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Well, I declare! The road up here must have been awfully muddy.

1156
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
What did she die of?

1157
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
In childbirth.

1158
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Childbirth! I’d forgotten all about that!

1159
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
My, wasn’t life awful — and wonderful.

1160
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
– Wonderful, was it? – Simon! Now, remember!

1161
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I remember Emily’s lovely wedding. What a lovely wedding it was!

1162
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And her reading the class poem at Graduation Exercises.

1163
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Emily was one of the brightest girls ever graduated from High School.

1164
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I’ve heard Principal Wilkins say so time after time.

1165
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I called on them at their new farm, just before I died. Perfectly beautiful farm.

1166
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's on the same road we lived on, hm-hm.

1167
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Aya, right smart farm.

1168
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I always liked that song . I hoped they’ll sing.

1169
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Good afternoon !

1170
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
– Good afternoon , Emily! – Good afternoon , M’s Gibbs!

1171
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
– Good afternoon , Mother Gibbs! – Emily!

1172
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Good a f ternoon.

1173
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
It’s raining!

1174
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Yes— They’ll be gone soon. Just rest.

1175
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
It seems thousands and thousands of years since I—

1176
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Papa remembered my favorite song .

1177
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Oh, I wish I’d been here a long time! I don’t like being new here !

1178
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
– Goo d afternoon , Mr. Stimson ! – Goo d afternoon !

1179
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Mother Gibbs, George and I have made that farm

1180
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
into the best place you ever saw. We thought of you all the time.

1181
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
We wanted to show you the new barn and a great long cement drinking fountain

1182
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
for the stock. We bought that out of the money you left us.

1183
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I did?

1184
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Don’t you remember, Mother Gibbs— the legacy you left us?

1185
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Why, it was over three hundred and fifty dollars !

1186
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yes, yes, Emily.

1187
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Well, there’s a patent device on this drinking-fountain so that it never overflows .

1188
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And it never sinks below a certain mark. G reat invention !

1189
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It won’t be the same to George without me, but it’s a lovely farm.

1190
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Live people don’t understand, do they?

1191
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
No, dear—not very much.

1192
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
They’re sort of shut up in little boxes, aren’t they?

1193
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I feel as tho I knew ’em last a thousand years ago—

1194
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
My boy is spending the day at Mrs. Carter’s.

1195
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Oh, Mr. Carter, my little boy is spending the day at your house.

1196
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Yes, he loves it there. ..

1197
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Mother Gibbs, we have a Ford, too. Never gives any trouble.

1198
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
I don’t drive, though. Mother Gibbs, when does this feeling go away?

1199
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Of being one of them? How long does it ?

1200
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I know .

1201
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Look, they're finished. They’re going.

1202
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Just wait and be patient.

1203
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Look! Father Gibbs is bringing some flowers to you.

1204
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
He looks just like George, doesn’t he?

1205
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Oh, Mother Gibbs, I never realized before how troubled and how —

1206
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
how in the dark live persons are. Look at him. I loved him so.

1207
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
From morning till night, that’s all they are—troubled.

1208
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Little cooler than it was. ..

1209
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Aya, that rain’s cooled it off a little.

1210
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Those northeast winds always do the same thing?

1211
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
If it ain’t a rain, it’s a three-day blow. ..

1212
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
But Mother Gibbs, one can go back; one can go back there again into living!

1213
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I feel it! I know it!

1214
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Why just then for a moment I was thinking about the farm—

1215
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
and for a minute I was there and my baby was on my lap as plain as day!

1216
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Yes, of course you can.

1217
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I can go back there and live those days over again—why not?

1218
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
All I can say is, Emily, don’t.

1219
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
But it’s true, isn’t it? I can go and live— back there—again.

1220
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yes, some have tried, but they come back.

1221
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Don’t do it, Emily.

1222
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Emily, don’t. It’s not what you think it’d be.

1223
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
But I won’t live over a sad day. I'll choose a happy one .

1224
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I’ll choose the day I first knew that I loved George.

1225
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Would that be painful?

1226
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
You not only live it; but you watch yourself living it.

1227
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And as you watch it, you see the thing that they never know.

1228
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
You see t he future. You know what’s going to happen afterwards.

1229
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But is that—painful? Why?

1230
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That’s not the only reason why you shouldn’t do it, Emily.

1231
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
When you’ve been here longer you’ll see that—

1232
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Our life here is to forget all that— and be ready for what is ahead.

1233
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Mother Gibbs, how can I ever forget that life?

1234
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I t’s all I knew. It’s all I had!

1235
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Oh, Emily! It isn’t wise. Really, it isn’t.

1236
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
But it’s a thing I must know for myself!

1237
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I’ll choose a happy day, anyway.

1238
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
No! At least choose an average day. Choose the least important day in your life.

1239
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It will be important enough.

1240
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Then it can’t be since I was married; or since the baby was born.

1241
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I can choose a birthday, can’t I?

1242
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I choose my twelfth birthday.

1243
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
All right.

1244
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It’s February 11th, 1899. A Tuesday.

1245
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Do you want any special time of day?

1246
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I want the whole day!

1247
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
We’lt begin at dawn. I t had been snowing for several days;

1248
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
but it stopped the night before, and they had begun clearing the roads.

1249
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
The sun’s coming up.

1250
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
There’s Main Street—why, that’s Mr. Morgan’s sweetshop before he changed it!

1251
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Yes, it’s 1899. Fourteen years ago.

1252
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Oh, that’s the town I knew as a little girl .

1253
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
And, look, there’s the old white fence that used to be around our house.

1254
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Oh, I’d forgotten that! I love it so!

1255
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
They... a re they inside?

1256
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yes, your mother’ll be coming downstairs in a minute to make breakfast.

1257
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Will she?

1258
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And you remember: your father had been away for a couple of days;

1259
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
he came back on the early morning train.

1260
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
No?

1261
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
He’d been back to his college to make a speech in New York, Clinton.

1262
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Look! There’s Howie Newsome! There’s our policeman! But he died!

1263
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Whoa, Bessie!

1264
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Morning, Bill.

1265
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Morning, Howie.

1266
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
You’re up early.

1267
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Been rescuin’ a party; darn near froze to death,

1268
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
down by Polish Town there. Got drunk and lay out in the snowdrifts.

1269
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
When I woke him up, he thought he was in bed.

1270
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
There’s Joe Crowell ...

1271
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Good morning, Joe!

1272
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Good mornin’, Mr. Warren. ’Mornin’, Howie.

1273
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Children! Wally! Emily! Time to get up!

1274
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Mama, I'm here? Oh, how young Mama looks!

1275
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I didn’t know that Mama was ever that young.

1276
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You can come dress by the kitchen fire, if you like, but hurry.

1277
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Good mornin’, Mr. Newsome. Whhh ... it’s cold.

1278
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Minus ten grades, Mis’ Webb.

1279
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Think of it! Keep yourself wrapped up.

1280
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Come on, Bessie .

1281
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Mama, I can’t find my blue hair-ribbon anywhere.

1282
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Just open your eyes, dear, that’s all, I laid it out for you special on the dresser, there.

1283
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
If it were a snake, it’d bite you.

1284
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Yes . Yes …

1285
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Good mornin', Bill.

1286
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Good mornin’, Mr. Webb. You’re up early.

1287
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Yes, just been back to my old college in New York .

1288
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Been any trouble here?

1289
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I was called up this mornin’ to rescue a Polish fella—

1290
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
darn near froze to death. ..

1291
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
We must get it in the paper.

1292
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
How did it go, Charles?

1293
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Oh, fine, I guess. I ’ve told him a few things… Everything all right here?

1294
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Yes—can’t think of anything that’s happened, special. Been right cold.

1295
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Howie Newsome says its ten below over to his barn.

1296
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Yes, well, it's colder than that at Hamilton College. Students’ ears are falling off.

1297
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
It ain’t Christian— Paper have any mistakes?

1298
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
None that I noticed. Coffee’s ready , you can drink it when you want .

1299
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Charles! Don’t forget; it’s Emily’s birthday. Did you get her anything?

1300
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Yes, I’ve got something here.

1301
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Where’s my birthday girl?

1302
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Don’t interrupt her, Charles. You can see her at breakfast.

1303
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
She’s slow enough as it is.

1304
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Hurry up, children! Seven o’clock. Now I don’t want to call you again.

1305
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
I can’t bear it. They’re so young and beautiful.

1306
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Why did they ever have to get old? Mama, I’m here! I'm grown up!

1307
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I love you all! I can’t look at everything hard enough.

1308
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Good morning, Mama.

1309
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Good morning, Mama , good morning, Papa .

1310
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Well, a very happy birthday to my girl and many happy returns.

1311
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,000
There are surprises waiting for you on the kitchen table.

1312
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Oh, Mama, you shouldn’t have ... I can’t ... I can’t ...

1313
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
But birthday or no t birthday, I want you to eat your breakfast good and slow.

1314
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I want you to grow up and be a good strong girl.

1315
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
That in the blue paper is from your Aunt Carrie

1316
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
and I reckon you can guess who brought the post card album.

1317
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I found it on the doorstep when I brought in the milk …

1318
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,000
George Gibbs— must come over in the cold — nice of him. ..

1319
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
George, I’d forgotten that ...

1320
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Chew that bacon slow and well. .

1321
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
It’ll help keep you warm on a cold day.

1322
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Mama … look at me one minute as though you really saw me.

1323
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Mama , f ourteen years have gone by! I’m dead! You’re a grandmother , Mama.

1324
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Mama , I married George Gibbs, Mama! Wally’s dead, too.

1325
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Mama! His appendix burst on a camping trip.

1326
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
We felt terrible, don’t you remember?

1327
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
But, just for a moment now we’re all together— Mama, let’s be happy—

1328
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Let’s look at one another!

1329
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
That in the yellow paper is something I found in the attic

1330
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
among your grandmother’s things.

1331
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,000
You’re old enough to wear it now, and I thought you’d like it.

1332
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And this is from you! Why, Mama, it’s just what I wanted. It's beautiful!

1333
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Your Aunt Norah couldn’t find one in Concord so I had to send

1334
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
all the way to Boston. Wally has something for you, too.

1335
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
He made it at Manual Training class and he’s very proud of it.

1336
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Be sure you make a big fuss. Your father has a surprise for you, too;

1337
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
don’t know what it is myself. Sh—here he comes.

1338
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Where ’s my birthday girl? Happy birthday, Emily!

1339
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Happy birthday to you...

1340
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I can’t go on! It goes so fast.

1341
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,000
We don’t have time to look at one another.

1342
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I didn’t realize.

1343
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So all that was going on and we never noticed!

1344
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Take me back—up the hill— to my grave.

1345
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
No . W ait!

1346
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
One more look .

1347
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Goodbye, goodbye, world .

1348
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Goodbye, Grover’s Corners ...

1349
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Mama and Papa ...

1350
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Goodbye to clocks ticking ...

1351
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
and my butternut tree! and Mama’s sunflowers— and food and coffee—

1352
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
and bacon that always got burnt onto the pan…

1353
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and new-ironed dresses and hot baths—

1354
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
and sleeping and waking up!

1355
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Oh, earth… you’re too wonderful for anyone to realize you!

1356
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it—

1357
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,000
every, every minute?

1358
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
No— Saints and poets maybe—they do some.

1359
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I’m ready to go back.

1360
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Were you happy , Emily ?

1361
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
No. I should have listened to you , Mother Gibbs . That’s all human beings are!—Just blind people.

1362
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Look, the sky ’s getting clear. The stars are coming out.

1363
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Mr. Stimson, I should have listened to them.

1364
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
N ow she know s . Now she know s : that’s what it was to be alive.

1365
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:44,000
To move about in a cloud of ignorance; to go up and down

1366
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
trampling on the feelings of those— of those about you.

1367
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
To spend and waste time as though you had a million years.

1368
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
To be always at the mercy of one self-centered passion, or another.

1369
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
T hat’s the ’’happy” existence you wanted to go back to. Now you know ...

1370
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Ignorance and blindness .

1371
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
That ain’t the whole truth and you know it, Simon Stimson.

1372
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Emily, look at that star. I forget its name.

1373
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
My boy Joel was a sailor —knew th em all.

1374
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
He’d sit on the porch evenin’s and tell th em all by name. It was wonderful for sure.

1375
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
A star’s mighty good company.

1376
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Yes , it is .

1377
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Here comes one of them.

1378
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
That’s funny! It ain’t no time for th em to be here. Goodness sakes!

1379
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Mother Gibbs! It’s George!

1380
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Sh-h, dear. Just rest yourself.

1381
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
It ’s George.

1382
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
And my Joel, who knew the stars— he used to say

1383
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
it took millions of years for that little speck o’ light to git down to earth.

1384
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
T hat's what he used to say ... millions of years.

1385
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Goodness! That ain’t no way to behave.

1386
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,000
He ought to be home.

1387
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
– Mother Gibbs? – Yes, Emily?

1388
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
– They don’t—understand—do they? – No, dear. They don’t understand.

1389
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Most everybody’s asleep in Grover’s Corners.

1390
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
There are a few lights on;

1391
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Shorty Hawkins, down at the depot, just watched the Boston train go by.

1392
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Voices can be heard from Ellerey Greenough's barn.

1393
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Yes, it’s clearing up. There are the stars— making their way,

1394
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
their ancient way across the vault of the sky . Scholars haven’t settled the matter yet,

1395
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
but they seem to think there are no living beings up there.

1396
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Just chalk—or fire.

1397
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Only this one is straining away to make something of itself.

1398
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
The strain’s so great that every sixteen hours everybody lies down and gets a rest.

1399
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Eleven o’clock in Grover’s Corners. Everybody’s goes to sleep.

1400
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Tomorrow starts a new day.

1401
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
You get a good rest too. Good night.
