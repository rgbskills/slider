1
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,978
In it you will see Dr. Gibbs,
Mrs. Gibbs, George Gibbs, Rebecca Gibbs,

2
00:03:19,322 --> 00:03:22,322
Constable Warren, Howie Newsome,
Joe Crowell, Si Crowell, Simon Stinson, Mrs. Soames.

3
00:03:29,494 --> 00:03:32,494
The name of our town is Grover’s Corners,
New Hampshire

4
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:52,839
The first act shows a day in our town.
The date is May 7, 1901,

5
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,011
Sky is showing some streaks of light
over in the East there,

6
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,097
the mornin’ star gets brighter
just before it has to go.

7
00:04:20,356 --> 00:04:23,356
Over there on the left is the railroad tracks.
The Congregational Church is over there;

8
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,442
the Presbyterian’s across the street.

9
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,528
Methodist and Unitarian are over there.
Baptist is—by the river.

10
00:04:35,614 --> 00:04:38,614
Across the tracks is—
the Catholic Church,

11
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Next to the Post Office is the
Town Hall; jail is in the basement.

12
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,786
Washington once made a speech

13
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,958
This is the Main Street.

14
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,044
Here are the poles that the horses are tied to.

15
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,131
First automobile’s goin’ to come
along in about five years—

16
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:14,217
belonged to Banker Cartwright,
our richest citizen.

17
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:19,303
Lives in the big white house
on the hill.

18
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:29,475
Here’s the grocery store
and Mr. Morgan’s drugstore.

19
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:34,561
Everyone in town goes
to those stores.

20
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,733
This is Doctor Gibbs’ house.

21
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,819
This is the back door.

22
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:54,906
Here’s a couple of trellises
for those who need scenery.

23
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:59,992
This is Mrs. Gibbs’ garden— Corn…
chickpeas... beans... peas... heliotrop

24
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:05,078
and lots of weeds.

25
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:10,164
Back then we got newspapers
twice a week—

26
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,250
the Grover’s Corners Sentinel—
this is Editor Webb’s house

27
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:25,422
Corn…

28
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:40,681
is a big walnut tree.

29
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,853
Nice town, right?

30
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:55,939
Nobody very remarkable
ever come out of it.

31
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,025
The earliest dates on
the tombstones in the cemetery

32
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:06,111
say 1670–1680. They’re Grovers
and Cartwrights

33
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:11,197
and Gibbses and Herseys—-
same names from here now.

34
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:16,283
Like I said: it’s early morning.
The only lights on are in a cottage

35
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:21,369
over by the tracks where
a Polish mother’s had twins.

36
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,542
And in the Joe Crowell house,
where Joe Junior’s gettin’ ready

37
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:36,628
to deliver the paper.

38
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:41,714
And in the depot, where Shorty Hawkins
is gettin’ ready

39
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:56,972
But town folks sleep late.
So—another day’s begun.

40
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:22,403
Mrs. Gibbs died of pneumonia
visiting her daughter Rebecca,

41
00:08:24,489 --> 00:08:27,489
who married an insurance man
in Canton, Ohio,

42
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,661
She’s buried in that cemetery—

43
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,833
in the Congregational Church.

44
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,919
In our town we like to know
the facts about everybody.

45
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:03,092
There’s Mrs. Webb

46
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,264
And here comes Joe Crowell
deliverin' the paper.

47
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:38,694
Anybody been sick?

48
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,781
No. Some twins born
in Polish Town —

49
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,867
I see your teacher Miss Foster
is getting married.

50
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:53,953
Yes, sir, to a man in Concord.

51
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,039
Well, how do you boys
feel about that?

52
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,125
Well, it’s not my business—

53
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:14,297
How’s your knee, Joe?

54
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:24,469
when it’s going to rain.

55
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:44,814
I want to tell you something about that boy.
Joe was smart—

56
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,900
graduated top of his class.

57
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:54,986
He got a scholarship to Boston
Tech—M.I.T.

58
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:00,072
Graduated top of his class from there too.

59
00:11:02,158 --> 00:11:05,158
It was in all the Boston papers
at the time.

60
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:10,244
Joe was going to be an engineering,
but the war started

61
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:15,331
and he died in France.

62
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,417
All that education for nothing.
What business he had fighting the Germans

63
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:25,503
we don’t know now, but it seemed
perfectly clear at the time.

64
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,675
Here comes Howie Newsome
delivering milk.

65
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:40,761
Giddy up, Bessie.
What’s the matter with you?

66
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:06,192
Going to rain, Howie?

67
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:11,278
No. Fine day,
with sunshine,

68
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:16,364
Hello, Bessie!
How old is she?

69
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,536
cancelled their milk delivery.
She wants to head that way

70
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,622
and yells at me
the whole time.

71
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:46,881
Doc

72
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,967
Is he? Seems like
you’re late today.

73
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:57,053
Aya. Something went wrong with the cart this morning.

74
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,225
Children, time to get up!

75
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,311
Come on, Bessie!

76
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:22,483
Everything ok, Frank?

77
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,569
Yes. Easy as kittens.

78
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,656
Bacon will be ready soon.
Come drink your coffee.

79
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,828
Can you get some more sleep
this morning?

80
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:47,914
Mrs. Wentworth’s cornin’ at
eleven with a stomach issue.

81
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I know what’s her problem.
Her stomach is not the same as it was.

82
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:58,086
You won’t get more than three hours sleep.
Frank Gibbs, I don't know

83
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,172
what’s goin’ to become of you.
I  wish you could rest more.

84
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:08,258
It would do you good.

85
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,344
Emily!

86
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,431
You’ve got to speak to George.

87
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:28,603
I can’t even get him
to cut me wood.

88
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:33,689
Is he sassy to you?

89
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,775
No, just whines!
All he thinks about is baseball—

90
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:48,947
George! Rebecca!
You’ll be late for school.

91
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:54,033
George! George, look sharp!

92
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,292
I’m going to lie down.

93
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:14,378
Wash yourself good
or I’ll do it myself.

94
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:19,464
Ma! What dress shall I wear?

95
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,636
I washed and ironed your blue dress.

96
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:49,981
Mama, George’s throwin’ soap at me!

97
00:15:57,153 --> 00:16:00,153
We got a factory in our town, too.

98
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,239
Makes blankets. Cartwrights own it,
made  a fortune.

99
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:15,411
Children! Now slow down.

100
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:25,583
Breakfast is just as important as lunch or dinner.
I won’t have you gobblin’ like wolves.

101
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,755
Oh, Ma! By ten o’clock I got to know
about Canada.

102
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,842
You know the rules —
no books at table.

103
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:45,928
I’d rather have my children

104
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:51,014
I’m both, Mama,
you know I am.

105
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I’m the brightest girl in school my age.
I have a very good memory.

106
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,186
Eat your breakfast.

107
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:11,358
I’ll speak to your father.
Twenty-five cents a week’s enough

108
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:16,444
for a boy of your age.

109
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,530
I don’t know how you spend it all.

110
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,617
Aw, Ma,—I gotta lotta
things to buy.

111
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:31,703
Strawberry phosphates—
that’s what you spend it on.

112
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,789
I don’t see why Rebecca gets much
money. She has more  than a dollar.

113
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,875
I’ve been saving up.

114
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:46,961
Well, I think it’s good to spend
some every now an’ then.

115
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:52,047
Mama, you know what I love most
in the world? Money.

116
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:02,219
There's the bell. I gotta go.

117
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:07,305
Don’t run.
Wally, pull up your pants.

118
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,392
Rebecca,

119
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:17,478
Yes, Ma.

120
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,650
You look nice, Rebecca.
Pick up your feet!

121
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,822
Here, here— No, you go away,— Here—
What's the matter with you?

122
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:42,908
All you do is fight— You don’t belong
to me. Where'd you come from?

123
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Good morning, Myrtle.
How’s your cold?

124
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,167
Well, I still have a tickle in my throat.
Told Charles I didn’t know

125
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:03,253
if I’d go to choir rehearsal tonight.

126
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,339
Have you tried singing

127
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,425
Yes, but I can’t stay on key.
While I’m restin' I thought

128
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:18,511
I’d string some beans.

129
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:23,597
Let me help.
Beans have been good this year.

130
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:28,683
Aya, I want to have forty quarts if it
kills me. Children say they hate ’em

131
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,769
but they’ll eat them
all winter.

132
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:38,855
Look,
Myrtle, I have to tell you something.

133
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:43,942
Why Julia Gibbs!

134
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:49,028
Tell me, Myrtle,
is one of those

135
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:54,114
second-hand furniture men
come to see you?

136
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
No

137
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,286
Well, he visited me.
First I thought he was

138
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,372
one of Doctor Gibbs’ patients.
He came inside

139
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:14,458
and offered me 350 dollars
for Grandmother Wentworth's highboy.

140
00:20:16,544 --> 00:20:19,544
Why, Julia Gibbs!

141
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,630
Yes, yes. On that old thing.
It was so big

142
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,717
I almost give it to my cousin,
Hester Wilcox

143
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,889
You don’t know!—three hundred and
fifty dollars? What’s come over you?

144
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:44,975
If I could get my husband

145
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:50,061
I’d sell it like that.

146
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:55,147
You know, Myrtil,
I’ve always wanted to see

147
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:00,233
I’ve been promising myself for years
that if we ever had the chance-—

148
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,319
How’s Doctor feel about it?

149
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:10,405
Well, I said if I got
an inheritance—

150
00:21:12,492 --> 00:21:15,492
that’s the way I put it—
I’d make him take me.

151
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:20,578
M-m-m— What did he say?

152
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,664
You know how he is. I haven’t heard a serious
word out of him, since I’ve known him.

153
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,750
No, he said, it might
make him discontented

154
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,836
with Grover’s Corners
to go to Europe;

155
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,922
Every two years he makes a trip
to the battlefields of the Civil War

156
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:46,008
and that’s enough he says.

157
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Mr. Webb’s ready to give up Napoleon
and move over to the Civil War

158
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:01,267
only Doctor Gibbs being one of the greatest
experts in the country makes him despair.

159
00:22:03,353 --> 00:22:06,353
It’s a fact,
my husband

160
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:11,439
The times I’ve walked over those hills,
Myrtle, stopping at every bush,

161
00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,525
like we was going to buy it.

162
00:22:23,697 --> 00:22:26,697
Well, if that second-hand man’s
serious Julia, you sell it.

163
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:31,783
And then you’ll get to see Paris.

164
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:36,869
Just keep droppin’ hints —

165
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:47,042
Oh, I’m sorry I mentioned it.
Only it seems to me that once in your life,

166
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:52,128
you ought to see a country where
they don’t talk in English

167
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:57,214
and don’t even want to.

168
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Thank you very much, ladies.

169
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:12,472
But first we want a little more information
about our town— a scientific account.

170
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,558
So I’ve asked Professor Willard of our
State University to discuss

171
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:22,644
our past history here.
Professor Willard?

172
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:32,817
May I introduce Professor Willard

173
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:42,989
Just a few brief notes, —
unfortunately our time is limited.

174
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:48,075
Grover’s Corners—mmm— let me see—
Grover's Corners lies

175
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,161
on the old pleiocene granite
of the Appalachian range

176
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:58,247
on some of the oldest land
in the world—

177
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:03,333
we’re proud of that. Of course there are more recent
outcroppings,—sandstone showing

178
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,419
through a shelf of Devonian basalt,
and some vestiges of Mezozoic shale,

179
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:13,505
but these are comparatively new—
perhaps two or three hundred million years.

180
00:24:20,678 --> 00:24:23,678
Some interesting fossils
have been found—

181
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,764
two miles north of the Peckham Farm—
in Silas Peckham’s cow-pasture.

182
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,850
These may be seen in the museum at
the University at any reasonable time.

183
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:38,936
Shall I read some of
Professor Gruber’s notes

184
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:44,022
on the meteorological situation—
mean precipitation, et cetera?

185
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:49,108
Afraid we won’t have time for that,
Professor.

186
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:54,194
We might have a few words
on the history of man here.

187
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,367
Early Amerindian stock,
Cotahatchee tribes—

188
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:09,453
no evidence before
the 10th Century —

189
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,539
now entirely disappeared—
Oh, possible traces in three families—

190
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:19,625
migration in early part
of the 17th Century

191
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:24,711
of English brachiocephalic
blue-eyed stock—

192
00:25:26,797 --> 00:25:29,797
Since then, some Slav
and Mediterranean—

193
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:34,883
And the population?

194
00:25:42,055 --> 00:25:45,055
Oh yes. The population
at the moment is 2,642.

195
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:50,142
The Postal District brings in 507 more—

196
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:55,228
making a total of 3,149.

197
00:25:57,314 --> 00:26:00,314
Mortality, birth rates—constant.
By McPherson’s gauge: 6.032.

198
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Thank you very much,
Professor Willard.

199
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:10,486
We are all truly obliged to you.

200
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:20,658
Now the political and social report:

201
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,830
Oh, Mr. Webb?

202
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:41,003
He’ll be here soon—
He just cut his hand eatin’ an apple.

203
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,519
All males vote at the age of 21.

204
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:16,605
Women vote indirect.

205
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:21,692
We’re lower middle-class:
sprinklin’ of professional men—

206
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:26,778
and
10% illiterate laborers: unskilled,

207
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,864
Politically,
86% Republicans;

208
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,950
6% Democrats; 4% Socialists;
Rest, indifferent.

209
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:42,036
Religiously, 85% Protestants;
12% Catholics;

210
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:47,122
Rest, indifferent.

211
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:52,208
Have you any comments,
Mr. Webb?

212
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:57,294
What do you think of our little town,
Grovers Corner’s, Mr Webb?

213
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,380
Well, if you ask me, I can tell you
that it

214
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:07,467
Little better behaved
than most.

215
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,553
Probably a lot duller. But our young people here
seem to like it well enough

216
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,639
90% of ’em settle down right here
to live—

217
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:22,725
even when they’ve-been away to college.

218
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:32,897
Is there much drinking in Grover’s Corners?

219
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:37,983
Well, ma’am, I wouldn’t know
what you’d call much.

220
00:28:40,069 --> 00:28:43,069
Saturday nights the farmhands meet
down in Ellery Greenough’s stable.

221
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:48,155
We’ve got one or two town drunks.
But they always repent whenever

222
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,242
a travelling preacher comes to town.

223
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:58,328
No, I’d say liquor
ain’t a regular thing in the home here,

224
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:03,414
except as medicine for a cold.
Or snake-bite, y

225
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,500
This has always been like that.

226
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:13,586
The next question is about social issues
and social injustice.

227
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,672
Why doesn't anyone do something about it?

228
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,758
Everybody is,—somethin’ terrible.

229
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,844
most of their time talking about
who’s rich and who’s poor.

230
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,930
Well, I dunno. I guess
we’re huntin’

231
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:39,017
for a way the diligent and sensible
can rise to the top

232
00:29:41,103 --> 00:29:44,103
and the lazy and quarrelsome
sink to the bottom.

233
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:49,189
But it ain’t easy to find.

234
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:54,275
Meantime, we take care of those
who can’t help themselves

235
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:59,361
and those that can we leave alone.
Any other questions?

236
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:09,533
I

237
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:14,619
Well, ma’am, there ain't much—not in the sense
you mean. There’s some girls

238
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:19,705
that play the piano over at High School
Commencement; but they ain’t happy about it.

239
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,791
There isn’t much culture;
but we like the sun cornin’ up

240
00:30:26,878 --> 00:30:29,878
over the mountain in the morning, and we all
notice a good deal about the birds.

241
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,964
And we watch the change
of the seasons:

242
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,050
yes, everybody knows about them.
But those other things—

243
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:45,136
there ain’t much—Robinson Crusoe
and the Bible;

244
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,308
those are about as far as we go.

245
00:30:57,394 --> 00:31:00,394
Now we’ll go back to town.

246
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:10,566
All
2642

247
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:15,653
The children have gone back to school.

248
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,825
Doc
tor

249
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,911
Mr. Webb’s cuttin’
his lawn —

250
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:35,997
one man in ten thinks it’s a privilege
to push his own lawn-mower.

251
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:46,169
I can’t, Lois.
I’ve got to go help my mother.

252
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:51,255
I promised her.

253
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:56,341
Emily, walk simply.
Who do you think you are today?

254
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,428
Oh, Papa, one minute you tell me
to stand up straight

255
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:06,514
and the next minute you call me names.
I don’t listen to you.

256
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,858
Sorry, Mrs. Forrest…

257
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,944
Hello, Emily!

258
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,030
H

259
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:42,116
You made a fine speech in class.

260
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:47,203
Well—I was ready to make a speech
about the Monroe Doctrine,

261
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,289
but at the last minute
Miss Corcoran made me

262
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:57,375
talk about the Louisiana Purchase.

263
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:02,461
I worked hard on both of them.

264
00:33:04,547 --> 00:33:07,547
Gee, it’s funny, Emily.
From my window I can see your head

265
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,633
nights when you’re doing your
home-work in your room.

266
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:17,719
Why, can you?

267
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:22,805
You stick to it, Emily.
I don’t see how you can sit still that long.

268
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:32,978
Well, I always feel it’s something
you have to go through.

269
00:33:35,064 --> 00:33:38,064
Yeah.

270
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:48,236
Yeah.

271
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,408
Emily, what do you think?
We might work out a kinda telegraph

272
00:34:00,494 --> 00:34:03,494
from your window to mine;

273
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,580
once in a while you could give me
hint about one of those Algebra problems.

274
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:13,666
I don’t mean the answers,

275
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,753
Oh I think hints are allowed.
So…

276
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:23,839
If you get stuck, you whistle

277
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:34,011
Emily, you’re naturally bright

278
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:39,097
I figure it’s just the way a person’s bom.

279
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:44,183
Yeah. But I want to be a farmer.
My Uncle Luke says

280
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:49,269
whenever I’m ready I can come work
on his farm

281
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,355
and if I’m any good
I can gradually have it.

282
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:59,441
You mean the house and everything?

283
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:09,614
Thanks for the talk, Emily.—
Good-afternoon, Mrs. Webb.

284
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:35,044
Emily, come help me string
these beans.

285
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,130
George Gibbs let himself have
a real conversation, didn’t he?

286
00:35:42,216 --> 00:35:45,216
Why, he's growing up.
How old is he?

287
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:50,303
Oh, I don’t know.

288
00:35:57,475 --> 00:36:00,475
Mama, I made a speech in class
today and I was very good.

289
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,561
You must recite it to your father at supper.
What was it about ?

290
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:10,647
The Louisiana Purchase.
It was like silk off a spool.

291
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:15,733
I’m going to make speeches all my life. —
Mama, are these big enough ?

292
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,905
Mama, can I ask you
something

293
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,991
Seriously, dear—not serious.

294
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:46,250
Mama, am I

295
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:51,336
Yes, of course. Both my children got good features.
I’d be ashamed if they hadn’t.

296
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:56,422
Oh, Mama, that’s not what I mean.
What I mean is:

297
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,508
I’ve already told you, yes.
You have a nice young pretty face.

298
00:37:03,594 --> 00:37:06,594
Now that's enough.

299
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Oh, Mama, you never tell us
the truth about anything.

300
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:16,766
I am telling you the truth.

301
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,939
Mama, were you

302
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:42,197
But Mama, you’ve got to say
something about me.

303
00:37:44,283 --> 00:37:47,283
Am I pretty enough
to get people interested in me ?

304
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:57,455
You’re pretty enough for
all normal purposes.

305
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:02,541
Come along and bring
that bowl with you.

306
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:07,628
Oh, Mama, you’re no help.

307
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Now, I think this is a good time
to tell you

308
00:38:19,886 --> 00:38:22,886
that the Cartwrights have begun building
a new bank in Grover's Corners—

309
00:38:24,972 --> 00:38:27,972
had to go to Vermont
for the marble.

310
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:38,144
And they've asked a friend of mine
what they should put in the cornerstone

311
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,230
for people to dig up
a thousand years from now.

312
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:53,403
and a copy of Mr. Webb’s Sentinel,

313
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,575
all that reading matter with a kind of glue—-
silicate glue—

314
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:08,661
that'll make it keep a thousand—
two thousand years—

315
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:13,747
We’

316
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:18,833
and a copy
of William Shakespeare’s plays.

317
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:34,091
Y’ know, Babylon once had
two million people in it,

318
00:39:36,178 --> 00:39:39,178
and all we know about them is
the names of the kings and some copies

319
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:44,264
of wheat contracts and—
the sales of slaves.

320
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,350
Yes, every night all those families
sat down to supper,

321
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:54,436
and the father came home from work,
and the smoke went up the chimney, same as here.

322
00:39:56,522 --> 00:39:59,522
So I’m going to have
a copy of this play

323
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,608
put in the cornerstone so people a thousand
years from now’ll know

324
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,694
about us—
more

325
00:40:16,866 --> 00:40:19,866
Well then, people living
a thousand years from now

326
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,953
This is the way we were,
in our growing up and in our marrying,

327
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,039
and in our living, and in our dying.

328
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:40,211
Now we’ll get back to Grover's Corners.
It’s evening.

329
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:45,297
You can hear the choir practice
in the Congregational Church.

330
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:55,469
The children are doing their homework.

331
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:05,641
The day is runnin’ down like a tired clock.

332
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:31,072
Let’s try it again!

333
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:41,244
Bles

334
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,330
the fellowship of kindred minds
is like to that above.

335
00:41:53,503 --> 00:41:56,503
Softer! Softer!

336
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:01,589
Get it out of your head that music’s
only good when it’s loud.

337
00:42:03,675 --> 00:42:06,675
You leave loudness to the Methodists.

338
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:11,761
You can't beat them at that,
even if you wanted to.

339
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,933
Now again, tenors!

340
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:47,364
I can’t work.
The moonlight’s terrible.

341
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:02,622
The third.

342
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:07,708
Why, yes, George—
that’s the easiest one.

343
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,880
I’ll tell you one thing:
the answer’s in yards.

344
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:38,225
Oh, I see. Square yards of wall-paper!

345
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:48,397
If you hold your breath, you can hear
the train all the way to Contookuck!

346
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,569
Hear it?

347
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:08,741
M-m-m— What do you know!

348
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:34,172
Before I forget:

349
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:39,258
How many of you can sing
at Fred Hersey’s wedding on Tuesday?

350
00:44:41,344 --> 00:44:44,344
Put your hands up.

351
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:59,602
"Art thou weary, art thou languid?"
It’s a question. Make it talk.

352
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,947
Ready?

353
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,119
Make yourself comfortable. I’ll only keep you

354
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:35,205
Me? I'm sixteen,
almost seventeen.

355
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:40,291
What do you want to do
after school’s over?

356
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:45,377
I want to be a farmer
on Uncle Luke’s farm.

357
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:50,464
You’ll be willing to get up early
and milk and feed the stock—

358
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,550
and you’ll hoe and hay all day ?

359
00:45:57,636 --> 00:46:00,636
Sure, I will. What do you mean, Pa?

360
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,808
Well, George, while I was
in my office today

361
00:46:12,894 --> 00:46:15,894
I heard a funny sound:

362
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,980
a

363
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,239
There you see your mother—
up early;

364
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:41,325
cooking meals all day;
washing and ironing;—

365
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:46,411
and still she has
to chop wood,

366
00:46:48,497 --> 00:46:51,497
I guess she got
tired of asking you.

367
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:56,583
She decided it was easier
to do it herself.

368
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:01,669
And you eat her meals,
and put on the clothes she washes,

369
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:06,755
and you run off and play baseball,—

370
00:47:19,014 --> 00:47:22,014
Well, I wanted to let you know.
Here's a handkerchief, son.

371
00:47:29,186 --> 00:47:32,186
25 cents a week.

372
00:47:34,272 --> 00:47:37,272
Not for chopping wood,
because that’s a present you give your mother,

373
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,358
but because you’re getting older—

374
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,444
I imagine there are things
you need it for now.

375
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,530
Thanks, Pa.

376
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:57,616
Let’s see—
tomorrow’s pay day.

377
00:47:59,702 --> 00:48:02,702
Probably Rebecca’ll feel she ought
to have some more too.

378
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:07,789
Wonder what could
have happened to your mother.

379
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,875
Choir practice never was
as late as this before.

380
00:48:14,961 --> 00:48:17,961
It's only half-past eight, Pa.

381
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:23,047
I don’t know why she's in that choir anyway.
She sounds like an old crow!

382
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:28,133
And traipsin’ around at this hour of the night!
About time you retired, don’t you think?

383
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:33,219
Yes, Pa.

384
00:48:45,477 --> 00:48:48,477
I’ll tell Mr. Webb; I know he’ll want
to put it in the paper.

385
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,650
My, it’s late!

386
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:03,736
Goodnight, Irma.

387
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Myrtle Webb! Look at that moon!

388
00:49:31,252 --> 00:49:34,252
Good potato-growing weather is coming,
that’s for sure!

389
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:39,339
Well, I didn't want to say it in front of those
others but now we’re alone—,

390
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:44,425
it’s the worst scandal ever in this town!

391
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:54,597
Now, Louella!

392
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:59,683
But, Julia! The organist of a church,
drunk year after year.

393
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:04,769
You saw he was drunk tonight.

394
00:50:06,855 --> 00:50:09,855
You know he was drunk tonight.

395
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:20,027
and Doctor Ferguson knows too.
A

396
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:25,114
th

397
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:35,286
Not to notice it!
But it’s getting worse.

398
00:50:37,372 --> 00:50:40,372
No, it isn’t, Louella.

399
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:45,458
I’ve been in that choir twice as long as you.
It doesn’t happen anywhere near so often.

400
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,544
Louella, look at that beautiful moon!

401
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:55,630
Those children will be up all night.
Goodnight, Louella.

402
00:50:57,716 --> 00:51:00,716
Goodnight, Myrtle.
Can you get home safe, Louella?

403
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:10,889
Oh, it’s bright as day. I can see

404
00:51:12,975 --> 00:51:15,975
You’d think we’d been to a dance
the way the men folk carry on. Goodnight, Julia.

405
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:21,061
Goodnight, Louella.

406
00:51:38,405 --> 00:51:41,405
Well, we had a real good time.

407
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,491
You’re late enough.

408
00:51:48,577 --> 00:51:51,577
Why, Frank, it ain’t any later than usual.

409
00:51:53,664 --> 00:51:56,664
And you stopping to gossip
with a lot of hens.

410
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,750
Don’t be grouchy.

411
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:06,836
Come smell
my heliotrope

412
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:11,922
Isn’t that wonderful?
What did you do tonight?

413
00:52:14,008 --> 00:52:17,008
Oh, I read—What were the girls
gossiping about tonight?

414
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,180
Worst I've seen him.
How’ll that end, Frank?

415
00:52:29,266 --> 00:52:32,266
Reverend
Ferguson

416
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,352
I guess I know more about Simon Stimson’s
affairs than anybody in this town.

417
00:52:39,439 --> 00:52:42,439
Some people ain’t made for
small town life.

418
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:52,611
No, not yet. —Frank,
I'm worried about you.

419
00:52:54,697 --> 00:52:57,697
What are you worried about ?

420
00:52:59,783 --> 00:53:02,783
I think you need a real rest

421
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:07,869
and change.

422
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:12,955
If I get that inheritance.
I’m going to insist on it.

423
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:18,041
Now, Julia, not that again.

424
00:53:25,214 --> 00:53:28,214
Come on, Julia, it’s late.
You’ll catch cold—

425
00:53:35,386 --> 00:53:38,386
You'll have your wood chopped,
for a while anyway. No, no.

426
00:53:40,472 --> 00:53:43,472
Oh dear, there’s always so many
things to pick up.

427
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:53,644
All those people that
part of town do.

428
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,730
They’re all gettin’ citified.
They haven't got anythin’ fit to steal..

429
00:54:05,902 --> 00:54:08,902
Get out, Rebecca.
There’s only room for one here.

430
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:19,075
Well, let me look just a minute.

431
00:54:21,161 --> 00:54:24,161
Use your own window.

432
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:29,247
There's no moon there

433
00:54:36,419 --> 00:54:39,419
George, do you know what I think?

434
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:44,505
I think maybe the moon’s getting
nearer and nearer

435
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,591
and there’ll be a big explosio

436
00:54:51,677 --> 00:54:54,677
You have no idea,
Rebecca

437
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:59,764
the men that sit up all night
with telescopes would see it

438
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,850
and it’d be in
all the newspapers.

439
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:15,022
and half the whole world?

440
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:20,108
Well—probably is.

441
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Nine-thirty.

442
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:35,366
Most lights in town are out.

443
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,539
Here comes Editor Webb, after putting
his newspaper to bed.

444
00:55:57,797 --> 00:56:00,797
All quiet tonight?

445
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:05,883
Simon Stimson is rollin’ around a little.
Just saw his wife out

446
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,969
looking for him so I looked the other way—
there he is now.

447
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,141
Good evening, Simon

448
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:26,227
Town seems to have settled down
for the night.

449
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:31,314
Yes, most of the people in town
have gone home, Simon.

450
00:56:38,486 --> 00:56:41,486
I guess we better do the same.

451
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:51,658
Can I walk along with you?

452
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,744
Good night.

453
00:57:03,916 --> 00:57:06,916
I don’t know how that’s goin’
to end, Mr. Webb.

454
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:12,002
Well, he's been trouble

455
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:17,089
Oh, Bill

456
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:22,175
give him a word?
He thinks a lot of you.

457
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:27,261
I don’t think he smokes,
Mr.Webb,

458
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:37,433
Hm. I hope not.
Good night, Bill.

459
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,519
Good night, Mr. Webb.

460
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:57,777
Why aren’t you in bed?

461
00:57:59,864 --> 00:58:02,864
I don’t know. I can’t sleep, Papa.
The moonlight’s wonderful.

462
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,950
And Mrs. Gibbs’s heliotropes.
Can you smell it?

463
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:13,036
Hm—Yes. No troubles on your mind,
Emily?

464
00:58:15,122 --> 00:58:18,122
Troubles, Papa. No

465
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:23,208
Well, don’t let your mother catch you.
Good night, Emily.

466
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:28,294
Good night

467
00:58:35,466 --> 00:58:38,466
I never told you about that letter
Jane Crofut got from her minister

468
00:58:40,552 --> 00:58:43,552
when she was sick.

469
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:48,638
The address on the envelope said:

470
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:53,725
Jane Crofut; The Crofut Farm,
Grover’s Corners; Sutton County;

471
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:58,811
New Hampshire;
United States of America.

472
00:59:00,897 --> 00:59:03,897
What’s funny about that?

473
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:08,983
Listen, it’s not finished: the United States
of America; Continent of North America;

474
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:14,069
Western Hemisphere; the Earth;
the Solar System;

475
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:24,241
What do you know!

476
00:59:46,672 --> 00:59:49,672
T

477
00:59:56,844 --> 00:59:59,844
Yes, the sun has risen a thousan

478
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,930
Summers and winters have cracked
the mountains more

479
01:00:07,016 --> 01:00:10,016
brought down some of the dirt.

480
01:00:12,102 --> 01:00:15,102
Some babies that weren’t even born before,
have begun talkin’ sentences;

481
01:00:17,188 --> 01:00:20,188
and a number of people who thought
they were young have noticed

482
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:25,275
that they can’t bound up a flight
of stairs like they used to.

483
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:30,361
All that can happen
in a thousand days.

484
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:35,447
Nature’s been pushin’ in
other ways, too—

485
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,533
a number of young people fell in love.

486
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:05,963
In our town there aren’t
many exceptions.

487
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:11,050
Most everybody climbs
into their grave married.

488
01:01:18,222 --> 01:01:21,222
So; three years later. 1904.
July 7th,

489
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:26,308
just after High School Commencement.

490
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:31,394
That’s when our young people
jump up and get married.

491
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,480
Soon as they’ve passed their last examinations,
looks like they feel themselves fit to get married

492
01:01:38,566 --> 01:01:41,566
and Cicero's words, it would seem that
they consider themselves marriageable.

493
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,738
It’s early morning.
Only this time it’s been raining.

494
01:01:53,825 --> 01:01:56,825
It was absolutely pouring down
with thunderstorms.

495
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,911
Mrs. Gibbs’s garden—
and Mrs. Webb’s here—drenched.

496
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:06,997
A lot of bean stems and pea pods
are full of water.

497
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:12,083
All yesterday, over on Main Street
the rain looked like curtains being blown along.

498
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:22,255
There’s the 5

499
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,341
And there’s Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Webb

500
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:32,427
making breakfast,

501
01:02:34,513 --> 01:02:37,513
I don’t have to point out to the women
in the audience

502
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,600
that both these ladies cooked
three meals a day,

503
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:47,686
one of ’em for twenty years
and the other for forty—

504
01:02:49,772 --> 01:02:52,772
no summer vacation.

505
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:57,858
They raised two children apiece,
washed, cleaned the house,

506
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:02,944
and never had a nervous breakdown.

507
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:08,030
Never thought themselves hard-used, either —
It’s like what one of those poets said:

508
01:03:10,116 --> 01:03:13,116
‘’You got to love life to have life,
and you got to have life to love life—’’

509
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:18,202
Do you know who said that?

510
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:23,288
Thornton Wilder, the author of this play.
As the saying goes – it’s a vicious circle.

511
01:03:35,547 --> 01:03:38,547
Giddy up, Bessie!

512
01:04:06,063 --> 01:04:09,063
Aya, reckon he is.

513
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:14,150
Now all he’ll be doin’ is pitchin’ hay.

514
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:19,236
Whoa, Bessie!
Guess I can stop and talk.

515
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:34,494
I don’t see how he could give
that up  to get married.

516
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,580
Would you, Howie?

517
01:04:46,752 --> 01:04:49,752
Mornin’, Howie!

518
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,838
Good morning
, Bill.

519
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:59,925
Seein’ if there’s anything
I can do to prevent a flood.

520
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:10,097
River’s been risin’ all night.

521
01:05:12,183 --> 01:05:15,183
Si Crowell here’s upset George Gibbs

522
01:05:17,269 --> 01:05:20,269
That’s how it goes. In '84 we had a player,
far better than George Gibbs.

523
01:05:22,355 --> 01:05:25,355
His name was Hank Todd.

524
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:35,527
He went to Maine and become a parson.

525
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:40,613
Wonderful ballplayer.

526
01:05:47,786 --> 01:05:50,786
Howie, how's the weather?

527
01:05:52,872 --> 01:05:55,872
Not bad. Think maybe

528
01:06:13,216 --> 01:06:16,216
Too bad about the weather. It’s been raining
so heavy that maybe it’ll clear up.

529
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:26,388
Looks like I’ll need three-a-milk
and two-a-cream.

530
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:41,647
My wife says to tell you, mrs. Gibbs,

531
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,733
we hope they’ll be happy.
And I’m sure they will.

532
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:51,819
Thanks, Howie. Tell your wife
I hope she gets to the wedding.

533
01:07:09,163 --> 01:07:12,163
Oh, good morning, Mr. Newsome.
I told you four quarts,

534
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:17,250
but I hope you can spare another.

535
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:22,336
Yes

536
01:07:34,594 --> 01:07:37,594
Well— I was just
telling Mrs. Gibbs

537
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,680
My wife

538
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:47,766
they’ll be happy,
M’s Webb,—know they will.

539
01:07:49,852 --> 01:07:52,852
Thank you,
and thank Mrs. Newsome

540
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,938
Yes, Mrs Webb. We hope to be
there Come on, Bessie!

541
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:08,111
Well, Ma. You’re losing
one of your chicks.

542
01:08:10,197 --> 01:08:13,197
Yes.

543
01:08:15,283 --> 01:08:18,283
Frank Gibbs,
don’t you say another word.

544
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:23,369
Sit down and drink your coffee.

545
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:33,541
The groom’s shaving,
only there ain’t much to shave—

546
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:38,627
whistling like he's glad
to leave us.—

547
01:08:40,713 --> 01:08:43,713
Every now and then he says “I do” to the mirror,
but it don't sound convincing to me.

548
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,800
Really, Frank,
I don’t know how he’ll get along.

549
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:53,886
kept his feet and warm things on—

550
01:08:55,972 --> 01:08:58,972
Frank, they’re too young!

551
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:04,058
He’ll catch his death-a-cold
within a week.

552
01:09:06,144 --> 01:09:09,144
I remember my wedding morning.

553
01:09:16,316 --> 01:09:19,316
I was the searedest young fella
in New Hampshire.

554
01:09:21,402 --> 01:09:24,402
I thought I'd made a mistake.

555
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:29,488
When I saw you coming down that aisle

556
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:34,575
I thought you were the prettiest girl
I’d seen;

557
01:09:41,747 --> 01:09:44,747
I was in the Congregational Church
marryin’ a total stranger!

558
01:09:51,919 --> 01:09:54,919
And how do you think I felt?
Frank, w

559
01:09:57,005 --> 01:10:00,005
Farces!
Here, I made you something.

560
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:05,091
Why, Julia! French toast!

561
01:10:07,177 --> 01:10:10,177
I had to do something.

562
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:20,350
Yes!

563
01:10:22,436 --> 01:10:25,436
Aya, I get a shock every time I think of George

564
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:30,522
setting out to be a family man!

565
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:35,608
There’s nothing so terrifying
in the world as a son.

566
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:40,694
The relation of father
and son is the damndest, —

567
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,780
Well, mother and daughter’s
no picnic—

568
01:10:47,866 --> 01:10:50,866
They’ll have troubles,
but that’s none of our business.

569
01:10:52,952 --> 01:10:55,952
Everybody has a right
to their own troubles.

570
01:10:58,038 --> 01:11:01,038
Aya… people are meant to live two-by-two in
this world. It’s not good to be all by yourself.

571
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:06,125
Julia, do you know one of the things I
was scared of when I married you?

572
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:11,211
I was afraid we didn’t have enough to talk
about for more than  a few weeks.

573
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:16,297
that we’d eat our meals in silence.

574
01:11:18,383 --> 01:11:21,383
Well, you and I been conversing
for twenty years without

575
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:26,469
any barren spells.

576
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:31,555
Well, good weather, bad weather,
I always find something to say.

577
01:11:33,641 --> 01:11:36,641
Did you hear Rebecca up yet?

578
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,727
No. Only day of the year Rebecca hasn’t been
managing everybody’s business.

579
01:11:43,813 --> 01:11:46,813
She’s hiding, might be crying.

580
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,900
Lord’s sakes—
this has got to stop.

581
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:56,986
Rebecca! Come get breakfast.

582
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:02,072
Good morning.
Only four more hours to live!

583
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,330
Now, George, put on your boots .
It’s raining torrents.

584
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:22,416
You don’t go out of this house
without being prepared.

585
01:12:24,502 --> 01:12:27,502
Aw, Ma—it’s just a step.

586
01:12:29,588 --> 01:12:32,588
You’ll catch your
death-a-cold through the service.

587
01:12:34,674 --> 01:12:37,674
George, do what your mother says!

588
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:42,761
From tomorrow on you can go wherever
and whenever you want,

589
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:47,847
While you’re in my house

590
01:12:55,019 --> 01:12:58,019
Perhaps Mrs. Webb
isn’t used to callers this early.

591
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:08,191
Here, take a cup of coffee.

592
01:13:15,363 --> 01:13:18,363
Just a sec.

593
01:13:25,536 --> 01:13:28,536
Good morning, Mother Webb.

594
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:38,708
Oh my God! You frightened me!

595
01:13:40,794 --> 01:13:43,794
Why not—?

596
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,880
Why, George, the groom can’t see

597
01:13:50,966 --> 01:13:53,966
his bride on his wedding day.

598
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:59,052
Aw,—that’s  superstition.
Good morning, Mr. Webb.

599
01:14:01,138 --> 01:14:04,138
Good morning, George.

600
01:14:06,224 --> 01:14:09,224
Mr. Webb, you don’t believe
in that, do you?

601
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:14,311
There’s common-sense
in superstitions, George.

602
01:14:21,483 --> 01:14:24,483
Millions have followed it,
George,

603
01:14:26,569 --> 01:14:29,569
and don’t be the first to fly
in the face of custom.

604
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:39,741
How is Emily?

605
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:44,827
She hasn't waked up yet.

606
01:14:46,913 --> 01:14:49,913
Emily’s asleep?

607
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:54,999
No wonder! We were up all night
sewing and packing.

608
01:14:57,086 --> 01:15:00,086
Now, George; you sit with Mr. Webb
and drink this cup of coffee;

609
01:15:02,172 --> 01:15:05,172
I’ll run upstairs and make sure
Emily doesn’t come downstairs.

610
01:15:07,258 --> 01:15:10,258
There's bacon, too.
But don’t stay long.

611
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,430
Well, George, how are you?

612
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:25,516
I'm fine. Mr. Webb, what commonsense could
there be in a superstition like that?

613
01:15:27,602 --> 01:15:30,602
Well, on the wedding morning
a girl’s head's full of clothes and—

614
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:35,688
one thing and another.

615
01:15:37,774 --> 01:15:40,774
That’s probably it?

616
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:45,861
I never thought of that.

617
01:15:47,947 --> 01:15:50,947
A girl's nervous on her wedding day.

618
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:56,033
Gee, I wish a person could get married
without all that marching.

619
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:06,205
It’s the women who’ve built up weddings.

620
01:16:08,291 --> 01:16:11,291
For a while now the women
have it all their own.

621
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:16,377
A man looks pretty small
at a wedding, George.

622
01:16:18,463 --> 01:16:21,463
All those women making sure the knot’s tied

623
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:26,549
in a public way.

624
01:16:28,636 --> 01:16:31,636
Well, you believe in it, don’t you,
Mr. Webb?

625
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,722
Yes. Oh, yes! Now,
don’t get me wrong, boy,

626
01:16:38,808 --> 01:16:41,808
marriage is a wonderful thing.
Don’t forget that, George.

627
01:16:43,894 --> 01:16:46,894
No, sir. Mr. Webb, how old were you
when you got married?

628
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,980
Well, I'd been to college and taken
a little time to get settled.

629
01:16:59,152 --> 01:17:02,152
Oh, age hasn’t got much to do with it,
George, compared with—

630
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,238
other things.

631
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,324
What were you going to say, Mr. Webb?

632
01:17:14,411 --> 01:17:17,411
Ah, I don’t know… Was I going to say something?

633
01:17:19,497 --> 01:17:22,497
I was remembering
the other night what my father said

634
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:27,583
when I got married.

635
01:17:29,669 --> 01:17:32,669
Charles, he said:
start right off showin

636
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:37,755
Best thing to do is to give an order,
just so she’ll learn to obey,

637
01:17:39,841 --> 01:17:42,841
Then he said: “If anything about her
irritates you,

638
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,927
the tone of her voice, or something else,
get right up and leave the house;

639
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:53,013
that’ll make it clear to her.”
And he said: "Never let your wife know

640
01:17:55,099 --> 01:17:58,099
how much money you have, never.”

641
01:18:00,186 --> 01:18:03,186
Well…

642
01:18:05,272 --> 01:18:08,272
So I took the opposite
of his advice

643
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:13,358
and I’ve been happy ever since.
So let that be a lesson to you

644
01:18:15,444 --> 01:18:18,444
never to ask advice
on personal matters

645
01:18:30,702 --> 01:18:33,702
A book came in on the Philo System
of raising chickens.

646
01:18:35,788 --> 01:18:38,788
I wish you’d read it.
I’m thinking of beginning myself,

647
01:18:40,874 --> 01:18:43,874
in the back yard! I’m going to put
an incubator in the cellar—

648
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:48,961
Charles Webb, are you talking about
that incubator again?

649
01:18:51,047 --> 01:18:54,047
I thought you were talking
about serious things.

650
01:18:56,133 --> 01:18:59,133
Well, Myrtle, if you want to give
the boy some advice,

651
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:04,219
I’ll go upstairs

652
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:09,305
George, Emily’s got to eat breakfast!

653
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:14,391
She sends you her love,
but doesn’t want to see you. Goodbye, George.

654
01:19:16,477 --> 01:19:19,477
Myrtle, guess you didn’t know
about that older superstition.

655
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:24,563
Since the caveman.
No bridegroom should see

656
01:19:26,649 --> 01:19:29,649
his father-in-law the day of the wedding.

657
01:19:31,736 --> 01:19:34,736
Or a day close to it.
Remember that.

658
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:39,822
I have to interrupt again.
You see, we want to know how all this began.

659
01:19:41,908 --> 01:19:44,908
The wedding… the plan for two people
to spend their whole lives together.

660
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:49,994
I'm terribly interested in how
big things like this start.

661
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,080
You know how it is: you’re 21 or 22
and you make some decisions;

662
01:19:57,166 --> 01:20:00,166
then whisssh– you’re 70;
you’ve been a lawyer for 50 years,

663
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:05,252
and that white-haired lady
by your side

664
01:20:07,338 --> 01:20:10,338
has eaten over fifty thousand meals with you.

665
01:20:12,424 --> 01:20:15,424
How do such things begin?

666
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:25,597
George and Emily will show you
the conversation they had

667
01:20:27,683 --> 01:20:30,683
when they first knew

668
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:35,769
”they were meant for one another”.

669
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:40,855
Before they do I want you to remember

670
01:20:42,941 --> 01:20:45,941
when you were very young,

671
01:20:48,027 --> 01:20:51,027
the days when you were first in love;

672
01:20:53,113 --> 01:20:56,113
when you were like a person
sleep-walking.

673
01:20:58,199 --> 01:21:01,199
You didn’t hear a thing they said to you.

674
01:21:03,286 --> 01:21:06,286
You’re a little bit crazy.
Will you remember that, please?

675
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:16,458
George has just been elected

676
01:21:18,544 --> 01:21:21,544
that means he will be the senior class
president next year.

677
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:31,716
And Emily’s just been elected
Secretary and Treasurer.

678
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:52,061
Goodbye. Oh, Ernestine!

679
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:57,147
Can you come over tonight
and do Latin ?—

680
01:21:59,233 --> 01:22:02,233
Isn’t Cicero the worst thing?—
Well, tell your mother you have to.

681
01:22:09,405 --> 01:22:12,405
Bye

682
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:17,491
Emily, can I carry your books home?

683
01:22:19,577 --> 01:22:22,577
Why—uh—thank you. It isn’t far.

684
01:22:24,663 --> 01:22:27,663
’Scuse me, Emily, will you?—
Say, Bob, if I’m a little late,

685
01:22:29,749 --> 01:22:32,749
start practice, and give Herb
some long high ones.

686
01:22:34,836 --> 01:22:37,836
Bye

687
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:42,922
Hello

688
01:22:50,094 --> 01:22:53,094
I’m glad you were
elected too, Emily.

689
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,180
Thank you.

690
01:23:05,352 --> 01:23:08,352
You’ve been treating me so funny lately.

691
01:23:10,438 --> 01:23:13,438
Well, since you ask,
I might as well say it , George—

692
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:18,524
Oh, goodbye. Miss Corcoran.

693
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:23,611
Goodbye, Miss Corcoran.—

694
01:23:30,783 --> 01:23:33,783
What is it?

695
01:23:35,869 --> 01:23:38,869
I don’t like the whole change that’s
come over you in the last year.

696
01:23:40,955 --> 01:23:43,955
Change?

697
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:49,041
I’m sorry if that hurts your feelings
but I have to tell you the truth.

698
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:59,213
Wha-what do you mean?

699
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:04,299
Well, up to a year ago, I used to like you
a lot. I used to watch you —

700
01:24:06,386 --> 01:24:09,386
because we’d been friends so long.

701
01:24:11,472 --> 01:24:14,472
And then you began spending

702
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:19,558
And you never stopped to speak to anybody
anymore not even to your own family, you didn’t.

703
01:24:21,644 --> 01:24:24,644
George,
ever since you’ve been elected Captain,

704
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,730
and conceited. All the girls say so.

705
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:34,816
And it hurts to hear 'em say it;

706
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:39,902
but I agree with ’em
because it's true.

707
01:24:41,988 --> 01:24:44,988
Gosh, Emily. I guess it’s hard
for a fella not to have

708
01:24:47,074 --> 01:24:50,074
some faults creep into his character.

709
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:55,161
I always expect a man to be perfect.
He has to be like that.

710
01:24:57,247 --> 01:25:00,247
Oh, I—I don’t think it’s possible
to be perfect, Emily.

711
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:05,333
Well, my father is.
And as far as I can see, your father is.

712
01:25:07,419 --> 01:25:10,419
No excuse why you shouldn’t be, too.

713
01:25:12,505 --> 01:25:15,505
Well, I feel it’s the other way round;

714
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:20,591
men aren’t naturally good, but girls are.

715
01:25:22,677 --> 01:25:25,677
Well, I’m not perfect.—
It’s not as easy for a girl to be perfect

716
01:25:27,763 --> 01:25:30,763
as a man, because we girls

717
01:25:43,022 --> 01:25:46,022
I don't know what made me say it.

718
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:56,194
Now I can see it’s not the truth.

719
01:26:08,452 --> 01:26:11,452
Emily—would you like
an ice-cream soda before you go home?

720
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,624
Well, thank you

721
01:26:28,797 --> 01:26:31,797
Hello, Stew, how are you?
Good afternoon, Mrs. Slocum.

722
01:26:33,883 --> 01:26:36,883
Hello, George. Hello Emily.
What’ll you have?—

723
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:41,969
Why, Emily Webb, what you been
cry in’ about?

724
01:26:44,055 --> 01:26:47,055
She got an awful scare,
Mr. Morgan.

725
01:26:49,141 --> 01:26:52,141
That—that hardware-store wagon
almost ran over her.

726
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:57,227
Tom Huckins drives like a crazy man.

727
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:02,313
D

728
01:27:14,572 --> 01:27:17,572
Gets worse every year—
What’ll you have?

729
01:27:24,744 --> 01:27:27,744
No, no, Emily—have an ice-cream with me.

730
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:32,830
Two strawberry and chocolate
ice-cream, Mr. Morgan.

731
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,916
Two strawberry and chocolate
ice-cream

732
01:27:40,002 --> 01:27:43,002
There are

733
01:27:45,088 --> 01:27:48,088
State Inspector was here yesterday.

734
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:53,174
And now they’re bringing in
these auto-mo-biles,

735
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:58,260
best thing to do is just stay home.

736
01:28:00,347 --> 01:28:03,347
Why I can remember when dogs
used to sleep

737
01:28:10,519 --> 01:28:13,519
There you are!

738
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:23,691
They’re so expensive.

739
01:28:30,863 --> 01:28:33,863
And then do you know what
else I'm celebrating?

740
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:38,949
I’m celebrating because I've got a friend
who tells me what ought to be told me.

741
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:44,035
George, don’t think of that.

742
01:28:46,122 --> 01:28:49,122
I don't know
why I said it. It’s not true. You’re—

743
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:54,208
No,
Emily,

744
01:28:56,294 --> 01:28:59,294
But I’m going to change so quick.

745
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,466
And Emily, I want to ask you a favor.

746
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:14,552
W-wh-a-t?

747
01:29:16,638 --> 01:29:19,638
I

748
01:29:21,724 --> 01:29:24,724
will you write me a letter once in a while?

749
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,810
I certainly will, George—

750
01:29:36,983 --> 01:29:39,983
It seems like being away
three years

751
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:45,069
you’d get out of touch with things.

752
01:29:47,155 --> 01:29:50,155
Maybe Grover’s Corners

753
01:29:57,327 --> 01:30:00,327
Grover’s Corners isn’t
a very important place when you think of—

754
01:30:07,499 --> 01:30:10,499
The day wouldn’t come when
I wouldn’t want to know

755
01:30:12,585 --> 01:30:15,585
everything about our town.
I know this is true, Emily.

756
01:30:17,672 --> 01:30:20,672
Well, I’ll try to make
the letters interesting.

757
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:30,844
Emily, whenever I meet
a farmer I ask him if he thinks

758
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:35,930
it's important to go to Agriculture School

759
01:30:48,188 --> 01:30:51,188
Yeh, and some of them say it’s
even a waste of time.

760
01:30:53,274 --> 01:30:56,274
You can get all that stuff,
anyway,

761
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,360
in the pamphlets the Government sends out—
Uncle Luke’s gettin’ old,—

762
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:06,447
he’s about ready for me
to take over his farm.

763
01:31:08,533 --> 01:31:11,533
My!

764
01:31:13,619 --> 01:31:16,619
And like you say,
being gone all that time—

765
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:21,705
in other places and meeting other people—
I guess new people

766
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:26,791
probably aren’t any better than old ones.

767
01:31:28,877 --> 01:31:31,877
I feel that you’re as good
a friend as I’ve got.

768
01:31:33,963 --> 01:31:36,963
I don’t need to go and meet new ones.

769
01:31:39,049 --> 01:31:42,049
But George,
maybe it’s important for you

770
01:31:44,135 --> 01:31:47,135
to go and learn all that cattle-judging
and soils and those things.

771
01:31:49,222 --> 01:31:52,222
Of course, I don’t know.

772
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:57,308
Emily I’m going to make up my mind
right now—I won’t go. Tonight I’ll tell my father.

773
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:02,394
Why George. I don’t see why you have
to decide right now—

774
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,480
It’s a whole year away.

775
01:32:14,652 --> 01:32:17,652
that fault in my character but there
was one thing wrong.

776
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:22,738
namely that for a year now I didn't pay
attention to anyone, and...

777
01:32:24,824 --> 01:32:27,824
You, for example. You say you were
watchin’ me when I did everything—

778
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,910
Why, I was doing the same about you.

779
01:32:34,997 --> 01:32:37,997
I always thought about you
as one of the chief people I thought about.

780
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:43,083
I always made sure where you were  sitting
on the bleachers. And we talked a lot in school

781
01:32:45,169 --> 01:32:48,169
and that was really important to me.

782
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:53,255
Of course it wasn’t as good as the conversation
we’re having right now.

783
01:32:55,341 --> 01:32:58,341
Then, lately, I started to observe that
you act a bit strange with me.

784
01:33:00,427 --> 01:33:03,427
And for three months not I’ve tried to walk home
with you; but something's always got in the way.

785
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:08,513
Yesterday, I was waiting for you,
and you walked home with Miss Corcoran.

786
01:33:10,599 --> 01:33:13,599
Oh, George!— Life’s awful funny!
How could I have known that?

787
01:33:15,685 --> 01:33:18,685
I thought—

788
01:33:20,772 --> 01:33:23,772
Listen, Emily, I’m going to tell you why
I’m not going to Agricultural School.

789
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:33,944
and fond of you, enough to be interested
in your character—

790
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:39,030
Well, I think that’s just as important
as college is,

791
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:44,116
even more so.

792
01:33:46,202 --> 01:33:49,202
I think that’s awfully important, too.

793
01:33:56,374 --> 01:33:59,374
Emily, if I make a big change:
could you be—

794
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:14,633
So I guess—this is an important
talk we've been having—

795
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,719
Yes

796
01:34:31,977 --> 01:34:34,977
Mr. Morgan, I’ll— I’ll have to go home
and get the money.

797
01:34:37,063 --> 01:34:40,063
What’s that? George Gibbs,
do you mean to tell me—

798
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:45,149
Yes. But I had important motivations,
Mr

799
01:34:47,235 --> 01:34:50,235
Look—here’s my gold watch
to keep until I come back.

800
01:34:52,322 --> 01:34:55,322
That’s all right.
Keep your watch. I’ll trust you.

801
01:34:57,408 --> 01:35:00,408
I’ll be back in five minutes.

802
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:10,580
I’ll trust you ten years, George —
not a day over.—

803
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:15,666
Got all over your shock, Emily?

804
01:35:17,752 --> 01:35:20,752
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morgan—
it was nothing.

805
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:36,010
Well, now we’ll get on to the wedding.

806
01:35:38,097 --> 01:35:41,097
There are a lot of things to be said about a wedding,

807
01:35:43,183 --> 01:35:46,183
and during the wedding there
can be a lot to think about.

808
01:35:48,269 --> 01:35:51,269
We can’t get them all into one
wedding, naturally,—

809
01:35:53,355 --> 01:35:56,355
especially not in Grover’s Corners,

810
01:35:58,441 --> 01:36:01,441
where weddings are mighty short and plain.

811
01:36:08,613 --> 01:36:11,613
In this play I take the part of the minister.

812
01:36:13,699 --> 01:36:16,699
That gives me the right to say
a few things more.

813
01:36:18,785 --> 01:36:21,785
Yes, for a while now the play gets
pretty serious.

814
01:36:23,872 --> 01:36:26,872
Y'see,—some churches say
that marriage is a sacrament.

815
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:31,958
I don't know what that means exactly,
but I have my suspicions.

816
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:42,130
A wedding is a god thing. But even
during such a joyful occasion,

817
01:36:44,216 --> 01:36:47,216
many doubts quietly creep
into the heart.

818
01:36:49,302 --> 01:36:52,302
Has the moment truly come
for me to take this important step?

819
01:36:54,388 --> 01:36:57,388
Is this person beside me really
the one and only

820
01:36:59,474 --> 01:37:02,474
whom God and fate have destined for me?

821
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,560
Like one of those European fellas said:
Every time a child is born into the world

822
01:37:09,647 --> 01:37:12,647
it’s Nature’s attempt to make
a perfect human being.

823
01:37:14,733 --> 01:37:17,733
Well, we’ve seen Nature pushing
and contriving for some time now.

824
01:37:19,819 --> 01:37:22,819
We know she’s interested in quantity;
but I think she’s interested in quality, too.

825
01:37:24,905 --> 01:37:27,905
Maybe she's tryin’ to make another
good Governor for New Hampshire.

826
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:32,991
That’s what Emily hopes.

827
01:37:40,163 --> 01:37:43,163
And don't forget the other witnesses,

828
01:37:45,249 --> 01:37:48,249
Millions of them. Most of them set out
to live two-by-two.

829
01:38:05,594 --> 01:38:08,594
I don’t know why I’m crying.
I guess I have no reason to cry.

830
01:38:20,852 --> 01:38:23,852
as she’s done for 17 years—

831
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:28,938
And now she’s going to eat in someone
else's house in the morning.

832
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:39,110
I suppose that’s it— And Emily suddenly said:
‘’

833
01:38:41,197 --> 01:38:44,197
And she put her head on the table
and she cried.

834
01:38:51,369 --> 01:38:54,369
T

835
01:38:56,455 --> 01:38:59,455
out into marriages.

836
01:39:01,541 --> 01:39:04,541
I hope she heard something from
one of her friends.

837
01:39:06,627 --> 01:39:09,627
It’s—it’s cruel, I know;
but I just couldn’t get myself to say anything

838
01:39:21,885 --> 01:39:24,885
The whole world’s wrong,
that’s what’s the matter.

839
01:39:32,058 --> 01:39:35,058
Eh, George!

840
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:40,144
Look at him, fellas. He’s scared to death!

841
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:45,230
George! You don’t have to look
so innocent, you old geezer.

842
01:39:47,316 --> 01:39:50,316
We know what you’re thinking.
Go to it, big boy, y’ old geezer you.

843
01:39:52,402 --> 01:39:55,402
All right! That’s enough of that.

844
01:39:57,488 --> 01:40:00,488
There used to be an awful lot
of that kind of thing in weddings in the old days

845
01:40:02,574 --> 01:40:05,574
We’re more civilized now,—so they say.

846
01:40:12,746 --> 01:40:15,746
George! What’s the matter?

847
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:20,833
Ma, I don’t want to grow old!
Why’s everybody pushing me so?

848
01:40:28,005 --> 01:40:31,005
No, no, George—you’re a man now I

849
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:36,091
Listen, Ma—for the last time I ask you.
All I want to do is to be a fella—

850
01:40:38,177 --> 01:40:41,177
George! If anyone should hear you!
Why, I’m ashamed of you!

851
01:40:43,263 --> 01:40:46,263
What? Where’s Emily?

852
01:40:48,349 --> 01:40:51,349
George, you gave me such a fright.

853
01:40:53,435 --> 01:40:56,435
Cheer up, Ma. I’m getting married.

854
01:40:58,521 --> 01:41:01,521
Let me catch my breath.

855
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,780
Why, Ma.What are you crying for?
Come on. We got to get ready.

856
01:41:18,866 --> 01:41:21,866
I never felt so alone in my whole life.

857
01:41:23,952 --> 01:41:26,952
And George, over there—I hate him—
I wish I were dead. Papa! Papa!

858
01:41:34,124 --> 01:41:37,124
Sh-h—Emily—Everything’s all right.

859
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:42,210
Why can’t I stay for a while just as I am?
Let’s go away—

860
01:41:44,296 --> 01:41:47,296
No, no,— Now think a minute.

861
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:52,383
Don't you remember what you
used to say—that I was your girl.

862
01:41:54,469 --> 01:41:57,469
There must be lots of places
we can go to.

863
01:41:59,555 --> 01:42:02,555
I'd work for you.
I could keep house.

864
01:42:04,641 --> 01:42:07,641
Sh! You musn't think of such things.
You're just nervous, Emily.

865
01:42:14,813 --> 01:42:17,813
George! George! Will you come here a minute!

866
01:42:19,899 --> 01:42:22,899
Why, you're marrying the best
young fellow in the world.

867
01:42:24,985 --> 01:42:27,985
I’m giving away my daughter, George.
Can you take care of her?

868
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:33,071
I want to—

869
01:42:35,158 --> 01:42:38,158
I love you. I need you.

870
01:42:40,244 --> 01:42:43,244
Well, if you love me, help me—
all I want is someone to love me.

871
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:48,330
I will, Emily, I'll try.

872
01:43:00,588 --> 01:43:03,588
Come, they're waiting for us.
Now, you know it’ll be all right.

873
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,760
Doesn’t she make a lovely bride?

874
01:43:20,933 --> 01:43:23,933
Do you, George, take this woman,
Emily, to be your wedded wife,

875
01:43:26,019 --> 01:43:29,019
to have and to hold from this day forward,

876
01:43:31,105 --> 01:43:34,105
in sickness and in health,
for richer for poorer,

877
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:39,191
to love and to cherish till death
do us part?

878
01:43:41,277 --> 01:43:44,277
Loveliest wedding I ever saw.

879
01:43:46,363 --> 01:43:49,363
I really like lovely weddings.
Doesn’t she make a lovely bride?

880
01:43:51,449 --> 01:43:54,449
Yes.

881
01:43:56,535 --> 01:43:59,535
Do you, Emily, take this man, George, to be your
wedded husband?

882
01:44:01,621 --> 01:44:04,621
Don’t know when I’ve seen
such a lovely wedding.

883
01:44:06,708 --> 01:44:09,708
But I always cry. I just like to see
young people happy.

884
01:44:11,794 --> 01:44:14,794
Don’t you? Oh, I think it’s lovely!

885
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,880
…till death do you part?

886
01:44:21,966 --> 01:44:24,966
I do!

887
01:44:27,052 --> 01:44:30,052
The ring!

888
01:44:37,224 --> 01:44:40,224
I’ve married two hundred couples.

889
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:45,310
Do I believe in it? I don’t know.
I suppose so. X marries Y..

890
01:44:52,483 --> 01:44:55,483
The cottage, the go-cart, the Sunday afternoon
drives with the Ford —

891
01:45:02,655 --> 01:45:05,655
the reading of the will—
Once in a thousand times it’s interesting.

892
01:45:22,999 --> 01:45:25,999
Aren’t they a lovely couple?

893
01:45:28,085 --> 01:45:31,085
I’ve never been on such a lovely wedding.

894
01:45:33,171 --> 01:45:36,171
I'm sure they'll be happy.
I always say: happiness!

895
01:45:38,258 --> 01:45:41,258
This is the most important thing in life!

896
01:46:03,688 --> 01:46:06,688
Gradual changes have taken place
in Grover's Corners.

897
01:46:08,774 --> 01:46:11,774
Horses are gettin’ rarer.
Farmers coming into town now in Fords.

898
01:46:18,946 --> 01:46:21,946
but everybody’s heard about ’em.

899
01:46:34,205 --> 01:46:37,205
This is certainly an important part

900
01:46:49,463 --> 01:46:52,463
often lots of sun and moon and stars.

901
01:46:54,549 --> 01:46:57,549
I often wonder why people like
to be buried in Woodlawn

902
01:46:59,635 --> 01:47:02,635
when they might pass the same time her

903
01:47:25,066 --> 01:47:28,066
Summer people walk around
there laughing

904
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:33,152
at the funny words on the tombstones.

905
01:47:40,324 --> 01:47:43,324
Iron pennants are on their tombstones.

906
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:48,410
Had a notion that the Union ought
to be kept together,

907
01:47:50,496 --> 01:47:53,496
though they’d never seen more than
fifty miles of it themselves.

908
01:47:55,583 --> 01:47:58,583
All they knew was the name

909
01:48:10,841 --> 01:48:13,841
This here is the new part of the cemetery.

910
01:48:15,927 --> 01:48:18,927
There’s your friend,
Mrs. Gibbs.

911
01:48:21,013 --> 01:48:24,013
And here's Mr. Stimson,
the

912
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:29,099
And Mrs. Soames who enjoyed
the weddin' so much, remember?

913
01:48:31,185 --> 01:48:34,185
Oh, and a lot of others.
Wall

914
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:39,271
while he was on a Boy Scout trip

915
01:48:46,444 --> 01:48:49,444
Yes, an awful lot of sorrow here.

916
01:48:51,530 --> 01:48:54,530
People wild with grief have brought
their relatives up to this hill

917
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:04,702
rainy days— snow—
You know how it is.

918
01:49:06,788 --> 01:49:09,788
A lot of thoughts come up here,
night and day, but no post office—

919
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,960
We all know that something is eternal
And it ain’t houses or names,

920
01:49:22,046 --> 01:49:25,046
and it ain’t earth, and it ain’t even the stars

921
01:49:32,219 --> 01:49:35,219
and th

922
01:49:37,305 --> 01:49:40,305
All the greatest people ever lived

923
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:45,391
and yet you’d be surprised how people
are always letting go of that fact.

924
01:49:52,563 --> 01:49:55,563
There’s something way down deep
that’s eternal about every human being.

925
01:49:57,649 --> 01:50:00,649
Y’know, the dead don’t stay interested in us
living people for very long.

926
01:50:02,735 --> 01:50:05,735
Gradually, they let go hold of the earth—

927
01:50:12,908 --> 01:50:15,908
and the people they loved.

928
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,080
Yes, they stay here while the earth-part
of ’em burns away,

929
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:31,166
and all that time they slowly get
indifferent to what’s goin’ on in Grover’s Corners.

930
01:50:33,252 --> 01:50:36,252
They’re waitin' for something they feel
is cornin’.

931
01:50:38,338 --> 01:50:41,338
Aren’t they waitin’ for the eternal part
in them to come out—clear?

932
01:50:43,424 --> 01:50:46,424
Some of the things they’re going to say
maybe’ll hurt your feelings—

933
01:50:48,510 --> 01:50:51,510
but that’s the way it is: mother 'n daughter
—husband ’n wife—enemy ‘n enemy—

934
01:50:53,596 --> 01:50:56,596
money ‘n miser— all those important things
grow pale around here.

935
01:50:58,683 --> 01:51:01,683
And what's left?
What’s left when memory’s gone?

936
01:51:03,769 --> 01:51:06,769
Well, here are some living people.

937
01:51:24,113 --> 01:51:27,113
Good afternoon, Joe Stoddard

938
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:32,199
Good afternoon
, good afternoon

939
01:51:39,371 --> 01:51:42,371
I’m Sam Craig.

940
01:51:44,458 --> 01:51:47,458
I should
have

941
01:51:49,544 --> 01:51:52,544
You’ve been away a long time, Sam.

942
01:51:54,630 --> 01:51:57,630
Yes, over twelve years. I’m in business
in Buffalo now, Joe—

943
01:51:59,716 --> 01:52:02,716
But I was in the East when I got news
of my cousin’s death, so I thought

944
01:52:04,802 --> 01:52:07,802
I’d come back and see the old home—
You look well.

945
01:52:14,974 --> 01:52:17,974
Yes, yes, can’t complain—
Very sad, our journey today, Samuel.

946
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:23,060
Yes.

947
01:52:25,146 --> 01:52:28,146
Yes, yes. I always say, I hate to supervise

948
01:52:35,319 --> 01:52:38,319
I had to come here early today—
my son’s supervisin' at the home

949
01:52:50,577 --> 01:52:53,577
He had lumbago.

950
01:52:55,663 --> 01:52:58,663
Yes, we brought Farmer McCarthy
here a number of years ago now.

951
01:53:05,835 --> 01:53:08,835
Why, this is my Aunt Julia—
I’d forgotten that she’d—of course!

952
01:53:16,008 --> 01:53:19,008
Today’s another bad blow for him.

953
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:29,180
That’s my sister Carrie’s boy

954
01:53:31,266 --> 01:53:34,266
I’m always uncomfortable when they’re around.

955
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:54,610
Doesn't sound like Aunt Julia.

956
01:54:01,782 --> 01:54:04,782
I wanted to look
at my father’s and mother’s—

957
01:54:17,041 --> 01:54:20,041
Simon Stimson...

958
01:54:22,127 --> 01:54:25,127
Nobody was supposed to know about it.
He's been through a lot of trouble.

959
01:54:32,299 --> 01:54:35,299
Oh, did he?

960
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:45,471
Chose his own epitaph.
It ain’t a verse exactly.

961
01:54:52,644 --> 01:54:55,644
Oh, I wouldn’t know. It was wrote up
in the Boston papers at the time.

962
01:55:12,988 --> 01:55:15,988
Had some trouble bringing a baby into
the world. ’Was her second, though.

963
01:55:18,074 --> 01:55:21,074
There's a little boy ’bout four years old.

964
01:55:28,246 --> 01:55:31,246
Yes, there ain’t much more room
over here among the Gibbses,

965
01:55:33,332 --> 01:55:36,332
so they’re opening up a whole
new Gibbs section over by Avenue B.

966
01:55:38,419 --> 01:55:41,419
You’ll excuse me now. I see they’re cornin’.

967
01:55:48,591 --> 01:55:51,591
Well, I declare! The road up here must
have been awfully muddy.

968
01:55:53,677 --> 01:55:56,677
What did she die of?

969
01:55:58,763 --> 01:56:01,763
In childbirth.

970
01:56:03,849 --> 01:56:06,849
Childbirth! I’d forgotten all about that!

971
01:56:08,935 --> 01:56:11,935
My, wasn’t life awful
— and wonderful.

972
01:56:19,107 --> 01:56:22,107
I remember Emily’s lovely wedding.
What a lovely wedding it was!

973
01:56:24,194 --> 01:56:27,194
And her reading the class poem
at Graduation Exercises.

974
01:56:39,452 --> 01:56:42,452
I called on them at their new farm, just before I died.
Perfectly beautiful farm.

975
01:56:44,538 --> 01:56:47,538
It's on the same road we lived on, hm-hm.

976
01:56:49,624 --> 01:56:52,624
Aya, right smart farm.

977
01:57:04,882 --> 01:57:07,882
Good afternoon

978
01:57:55,744 --> 01:57:58,744
It seems thousands and thousands
of years since I—

979
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:29,260
Mother Gibbs, George and I have
made that farm

980
01:58:31,346 --> 01:58:34,346
into the best place you ever saw.
We thought of you all the time.

981
01:58:36,432 --> 01:58:39,432
We wanted to show you the new barn
and a great long cement drinking fountain

982
01:58:41,519 --> 01:58:44,519
for the stock. We bought that out
of the money you left us.

983
01:58:46,605 --> 01:58:49,605
I did?

984
01:58:51,691 --> 01:58:54,691
Don’t you remember, Mother Gibbs—
the legacy you left us?

985
01:58:56,777 --> 01:58:59,777
Why, it was over three hundred
and fifty dollars

986
01:59:01,863 --> 01:59:04,863
Yes, yes, Emily.

987
01:59:06,949 --> 01:59:09,949
Well, there’s a patent device on this
drinking-fountain so that it never overflows

988
01:59:22,207 --> 01:59:25,207
It won’t be the same to George without me,
but it’s a lovely farm.

989
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:35,380
Live people don’t understand, do they?

990
01:59:37,466 --> 01:59:40,466
No, dear—not very much.

991
01:59:47,638 --> 01:59:50,638
They’re sort of shut up in little boxes,
aren’t they?

992
01:59:52,724 --> 01:59:55,724
I feel as tho I knew ’em
last a thousand years ago—

993
01:59:57,810 --> 02:00:00,810
My boy is spending the day at Mrs. Carter’s.

994
02:00:02,896 --> 02:00:05,896
Oh, Mr. Carter, my little boy is spending
the day at your house.

995
02:00:07,982 --> 02:00:10,982
Yes, he loves it there.

996
02:00:13,069 --> 02:00:16,069
Mother Gibbs,
we have a Ford, too. Never gives any trouble.

997
02:00:23,241 --> 02:00:26,241
Of being one of them? How long does it

998
02:00:33,413 --> 02:00:36,413
I know

999
02:00:38,499 --> 02:00:41,499
Look, they're finished. They’re going.

1000
02:00:43,585 --> 02:00:46,585
Just wait and be patient.

1001
02:00:58,844 --> 02:01:01,844
He looks just like George, doesn’t he?

1002
02:01:14,102 --> 02:01:17,102
how in the dark live persons are.
Look at him. I loved him so.

1003
02:01:19,188 --> 02:01:22,188
From morning till night,
that’s all they are—troubled.

1004
02:01:24,274 --> 02:01:27,274
Little cooler than it was.

1005
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,360
Aya, that rain’s cooled it off a little.

1006
02:01:34,446 --> 02:01:37,446
Those northeast winds always do
the same thing?

1007
02:01:39,532 --> 02:01:42,532
If

1008
02:01:44,619 --> 02:01:47,619
But Mother Gibbs, one can go back;
one can go back there again into living!

1009
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:57,791
Why just then for a moment
I was thinking about the farm—

1010
02:01:59,877 --> 02:02:02,877
and for a minute I was there and my baby
was on my lap as plain as day!

1011
02:02:04,963 --> 02:02:07,963
Yes, of course you can.

1012
02:02:15,135 --> 02:02:18,135
I can go back there and live
those days over again—why not?

1013
02:02:20,221 --> 02:02:23,221
All I can say is, Emily, don’t.

1014
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:38,480
Don’t do it, Emily.

1015
02:02:50,738 --> 02:02:53,738
I’ll choose the day I first knew

1016
02:03:05,996 --> 02:03:08,996
And as you watch it,
you see the thing that they never know.

1017
02:03:11,082 --> 02:03:14,082
You see
t

1018
02:03:16,169 --> 02:03:19,169
But is that—painful? Why?

1019
02:03:26,341 --> 02:03:29,341
When you’ve been here
longer you’ll see that—

1020
02:03:31,427 --> 02:03:34,427
Our life here is to forget all that—

1021
02:03:36,513 --> 02:03:39,513
Mother Gibbs,

1022
02:03:56,857 --> 02:03:59,857
I’ll choose a happy day, anyway.

1023
02:04:12,116 --> 02:04:15,116
It will be important enough.

1024
02:04:27,374 --> 02:04:30,374
I can choose a birthday, can’t I?

1025
02:04:47,719 --> 02:04:50,719
All right.

1026
02:04:57,891 --> 02:05:00,891
It’s February 11th, 1899. A Tuesday.

1027
02:05:08,063 --> 02:05:11,063
Do you want any special time of day?

1028
02:05:28,407 --> 02:05:31,407
but it stopped the night before, and they
had begun clearing the roads.

1029
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:56,838
Oh, that’s the town I knew as a little girl

1030
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:07,010
And, look, there’s the old white fence
that used to be around our house.

1031
02:06:09,096 --> 02:06:12,096
Oh, I’d forgotten that!
I love it so!

1032
02:06:14,182 --> 02:06:17,182
They... a

1033
02:06:24,355 --> 02:06:27,355
Will she?

1034
02:06:29,441 --> 02:06:32,441
And you remember: your father
had been away for a couple of days;

1035
02:06:34,527 --> 02:06:37,527
he came back on the early morning train.

1036
02:06:39,613 --> 02:06:42,613
No?

1037
02:06:49,785 --> 02:06:52,785
Look! There’s Howie Newsome!

1038
02:06:59,957 --> 02:07:02,957
Whoa, Bessie!

1039
02:07:10,130 --> 02:07:13,130
Morning, Howie.

1040
02:07:15,216 --> 02:07:18,216
You’re up early.

1041
02:07:20,302 --> 02:07:23,302
Been rescuin’ a party;
darn near froze to death,

1042
02:07:25,388 --> 02:07:28,388
down by Polish Town there.
Got drunk and lay out in the snowdrifts.

1043
02:07:30,474 --> 02:07:33,474
When I woke him up, he thought he was in bed.

1044
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:38,560
There’s Joe Crowell

1045
02:07:40,646 --> 02:07:43,646
Good morning, Joe!

1046
02:07:45,732 --> 02:07:48,732
Good mornin’, Mr. Warren.
’Mornin’, Howie.

1047
02:07:50,818 --> 02:07:53,818
Children! Wally! Emily!
Time to get up!

1048
02:08:06,077 --> 02:08:09,077
You can come dress by the kitchen fire,
if you like, but hurry.

1049
02:08:11,163 --> 02:08:14,163
Good mornin’, Mr. Newsome.
Whhh

1050
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:19,249
Minus ten grades, Mis’ Webb.

1051
02:08:21,335 --> 02:08:24,335
Think of it! Keep yourself wrapped up.

1052
02:08:26,421 --> 02:08:29,421
Come on, Bessie

1053
02:08:31,507 --> 02:08:34,507
Mama, I can’t find my blue
hair-ribbon anywhere.

1054
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,680
Just open your eyes, dear, that’s all,
I laid it out for you special on the dresser, there.

1055
02:08:46,766 --> 02:08:49,766
If it were a snake, it’d bite you.

1056
02:09:02,024 --> 02:09:05,024
Good mornin', Bill.

1057
02:09:07,110 --> 02:09:10,110
Good mornin’, Mr. Webb.
You’re up early.

1058
02:09:12,196 --> 02:09:15,196
Yes, just been back to my old college
in New York

1059
02:09:22,368 --> 02:09:25,368
I was called up this mornin’
to rescue a Polish fella—

1060
02:09:27,455 --> 02:09:30,455
darn near froze to death.

1061
02:09:32,541 --> 02:09:35,541
We must get it in the paper.

1062
02:09:42,713 --> 02:09:45,713
How did it go, Charles?

1063
02:09:47,799 --> 02:09:50,799
Oh, fine, I guess.
I

1064
02:09:57,971 --> 02:10:00,971
Howie Newsome says its ten
below over to his barn.

1065
02:10:03,057 --> 02:10:06,057
Yes, well, it's colder than that at Hamilton
College. Students’ ears are falling off.

1066
02:10:08,143 --> 02:10:11,143
It ain’t Christian—
Paper have any mistakes?

1067
02:10:13,230 --> 02:10:16,230
None that I noticed.
Coffee’s ready

1068
02:10:18,316 --> 02:10:21,316
Charles! Don’t forget; it’s Emily’s birthday.
Did you get her anything?

1069
02:10:23,402 --> 02:10:26,402
Yes, I’ve got something here.

1070
02:10:33,574 --> 02:10:36,574
Where’s my birthday girl?

1071
02:10:53,918 --> 02:10:56,918
Hurry up, children! Seven o’clock.
Now I don’t want to call you again.

1072
02:11:04,091 --> 02:11:07,091
Why did they ever have to get old?
Mama, I’m here! I'm grown up!

1073
02:11:19,349 --> 02:11:22,349
Good morning, Mama.

1074
02:11:29,521 --> 02:11:32,521
Well, a very happy birthday
to my girl and many happy returns.

1075
02:11:34,607 --> 02:11:37,607
There are surprises waiting
for you on the kitchen table.

1076
02:11:44,780 --> 02:11:47,780
Oh,

1077
02:11:49,866 --> 02:11:52,866
But birthday or no

1078
02:11:54,952 --> 02:11:57,952
I want you to grow up
and be a good strong girl.

1079
02:12:00,038 --> 02:12:03,038
That in the blue paper
is from your Aunt Carrie

1080
02:12:05,124 --> 02:12:08,124
and I reckon you can guess who brought
the post card album.

1081
02:12:15,296 --> 02:12:18,296
George Gibbs— must come over
in the cold — nice of him.

1082
02:12:25,468 --> 02:12:28,468
Chew that bacon

1083
02:12:30,555 --> 02:12:33,555
It’ll help keep you warm on a cold day.

1084
02:12:40,727 --> 02:12:43,727
Mama
,

1085
02:12:45,813 --> 02:12:48,813
Mama
,

1086
02:12:50,899 --> 02:12:53,899
Mama! His appendix burst
on a camping trip.

1087
02:12:55,985 --> 02:12:58,985
We felt terrible,
don’t you remember?

1088
02:13:01,071 --> 02:13:04,071
But, just for a moment now we’re all
together— Mama, let’s be happy—

1089
02:13:06,157 --> 02:13:09,157
Let’s look at one another!

1090
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:19,330
among your grandmother’s things.

1091
02:13:26,502 --> 02:13:29,502
And this is from you! Why, Mama, it’s just
what I wanted. It's beautiful!

1092
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,760
He made it at Manual Training class
and he’s very proud of it.

1093
02:13:46,846 --> 02:13:49,846
Be sure you make a big fuss.
Your father has a surprise for you, too;

1094
02:14:02,105 --> 02:14:05,105
Where
’s my birthday girl?

1095
02:14:07,191 --> 02:14:10,191
Happy birthday to you...

1096
02:14:12,277 --> 02:14:15,277
I can’t go on!
It goes so fast.

1097
02:14:17,363 --> 02:14:20,363
We don’t have time
to look at one another.

1098
02:14:22,449 --> 02:14:25,449
I didn’t realize.

1099
02:14:27,535 --> 02:14:30,535
So all that was going on
and we never noticed!

1100
02:15:08,224 --> 02:15:11,224
Goodbye,

1101
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:16,310
Goodbye, Grover’s Corners

1102
02:15:18,396 --> 02:15:21,396
Mama and Papa

1103
02:15:28,568 --> 02:15:31,568
and my butternut tree! and Mama’s sunflowers—
and food and coffee—

1104
02:15:33,655 --> 02:15:36,655
and bacon that always got burnt onto the pan…

1105
02:15:38,741 --> 02:15:41,741
and new-ironed dresses and hot baths—

1106
02:15:43,827 --> 02:15:46,827
and sleeping and waking up!

1107
02:15:48,913 --> 02:15:51,913
Oh, earth… you’re too wonderful
for anyone to realize you!

1108
02:16:04,171 --> 02:16:07,171
every, every minute?

1109
02:16:09,257 --> 02:16:12,257
No— Saints and poets maybe—they do some.

1110
02:16:49,946 --> 02:16:52,946
Look,
the sky

1111
02:17:05,205 --> 02:17:08,205
To move about in a cloud of ignorance;
to go up and down

1112
02:17:15,377 --> 02:17:18,377
To spend and waste time as though
you had a million years.

1113
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:28,549
To be always at the mercy of one
self-centered passion, or another.

1114
02:17:35,721 --> 02:17:38,721
Ignorance and blindness

1115
02:17:45,893 --> 02:17:48,893
That ain’t the whole truth
and you know it, Simon Stimson.

1116
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:53,980
Emily, look at that star.
I forget its name.

1117
02:18:01,152 --> 02:18:04,152
My boy Joel was a sailor
—knew

1118
02:18:06,238 --> 02:18:09,238
He’d sit on the porch evenin’s and tell

1119
02:18:16,410 --> 02:18:19,410
Yes

1120
02:18:26,582 --> 02:18:29,582
That’s funny!
It

1121
02:18:31,668 --> 02:18:34,668
Mother Gibbs! It’s George!

1122
02:18:36,755 --> 02:18:39,755
Sh-h, dear. Just rest yourself.

1123
02:18:41,841 --> 02:18:44,841
It

1124
02:18:46,927 --> 02:18:49,927
And my Joel, who knew the stars—
he used to say

1125
02:18:52,013 --> 02:18:55,013
it took millions of years for that little
speck o’ light to git down to earth.

1126
02:19:02,185 --> 02:19:05,185
Goodness!
That ain’t no way to behave.

1127
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:10,271
He ought to be home.

1128
02:19:12,357 --> 02:19:15,357
–

1129
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:30,616
Most everybody’s asleep in Grover’s Corners.

1130
02:19:37,788 --> 02:19:40,788
There are a few lights on;

1131
02:19:58,132 --> 02:20:01,132
their ancient way across the vault of
the sky

1132
02:20:08,305 --> 02:20:11,305
Just chalk—or fire.

1133
02:20:18,477 --> 02:20:21,477
Only this one is straining away
to make something of itself.

1134
02:20:43,907 --> 02:20:46,907
You get a good rest too.
Good night.
