1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Three of spades. Razor blades.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Indeed, yes!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Eugene…

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well… plunk…

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Plunk what, Eugene?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The old gentleman's not in form today.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Eugene! If you're going to play with us, you've got to do it right.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Plunk's all right, but then what?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, just plain plunk!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
God, he’s blushing again.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Maybe… ”plunk-plunk”.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Certainly not. Why don't you help him out, Eddie?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
With plunk? That's a tough word to work with.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How about: Scram, Sam. We're on the lam.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Splendid. But if you'll excuse my asking, what does it mean? Who's on the lam?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's what they say, that's all.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don’t make a fuss. Mr. Eddie is an expert.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's what they say, that's all.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
See, with a little effort you can do it too.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The old gentleman is a bit bashful…

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thank you, Eddie dear. I don't know what we would do without you

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It’s nothing… I'd better be leaving.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What? Why? What's got into you? Right in the middle of our game?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Good afternoon !

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, it's you.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
M e. What's going on here anyway?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you mean? We're just having our little game.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can see that. But with whom?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
With whom? Don't you recognize your Uncle Eugene any more?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I wasn't asking about Uncle Eugene. I'll settle with him later.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Who is this individual?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll just be running along now: Madam, the pleasure was mine.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Edward! Stay!

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Out! Out!

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dear lady, didn't I tell you we shouldn't have played today?

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's her fault. Entirely her fault. I didn't even want to play.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I said : o ut!

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Easy, Aces. I'm going!

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How often have I told you never to let this happen again? Mom!

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No! No!

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh yes, oh yes! And right now too!

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What do you want of me anyway?

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know very well what I want.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Arthur, have you no pity for your own grandmother?

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, so you're talking back again are you, Uncle?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Interesting, interesting !

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Not at all. I simply wanted to say that even if Eugenia may have forgotten herself a bit. ..

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then I'll just have to remind her. And you too, Uncle. Pity!

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How can you talk about pity? Do any of you have any pity for me?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Does she ever try to understand me? Uncle, you're going to get what's coming to you.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why aren't you working? Why aren't you writing your memoirs?

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I did write a bit this morning, but then they came barging into my room, and…

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Eugene! Traitor!

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why can't you all just leave me in peace?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But you've got to be punished too. Now sit there until I let you out.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Serves him right.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't think you're going to get off free. Hup! Up you go!

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Again? I don't want to!

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Not another word!

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Terrific!

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you, Judas!

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Your cards were no good anyway.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Fool!

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Shut up! This ought to cure you of your disgusting frivolity.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Matches! Who's got a match?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
At least spare me the candles, Arthur.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Quiet, or I'll think up something really grim.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here!

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Great pictures!

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's he looking at?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Handbook of anatomy. University edition.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is Mr. Arthur studying medicine?

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's studying for three different degrees. One in philosophy.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They don't illustrate philosophy.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They don’t.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Too bad. It might be good.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let me see!

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Lie down!

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To think that you're the youngest one of us all! Why don't you enter a monastery?

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why do you simply refuse to understand me, Grandmother?

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why do you refuse to understand him, Eugenia?

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I just can't live in a world like this!

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What kind of world? What are you people doing?

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Good morning, Mother.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Mama! On the catafalque again?

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A good thing you've come Now you can see for yourself how he treats me.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How I treat you? She had to be disciplined.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's trying to educate me.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She really goes too far.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
– What did she do? – She knows.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But why the catafalque?

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
To remind her of eternity. Let her lie there and look within.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ah, Eddie !

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hi!

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You mean you know each other?

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Here we go.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Everybody knows Eddie. Why not?

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I m going mad. I come home and what do I find? Laxity, chaos, shady characters,

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
ambiquous relationships. And on top of all that, it turns out that even you.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No! No! Why does all this have to happen? Where is it all going to end?

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Perhaps you'd like something to eat?

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Eat? No. All I want is to get the situation under control.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I sleep with Eddie from time to time. Don't I, Eddie?

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What? Oh yes. Of course.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Somewhat of an understatement.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's that? What did you say, Mother?

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm off… I'll get you something to eat right away.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Look at that! And all in color!

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Arthur… May I take this off now?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's wrong, Arthur?

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Christ, this thing is hard!

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I understand that this business about your mother.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can well understand that. I'm an old-timer. ..

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Eddie's not a bad sort. He has a good heart even if he doesn't look very bright.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Between you and me, he's not quite all there. ..

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But what can you expect, my dear boy?

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Life must be taken as it is… or must it? Now, now, Arthur. Chin up!

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Eddie has his good points, and after all, my goodness we've got to face up to it:

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
your mother isn't quite what she used to be.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You should have seen her when she was young, before you were born, of course.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What are you planning to do about Eddie anyway?

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Frankly, he's a thoroughly bad sort. His fingernails are always so dirty.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I'm convinced that he cheats at cards.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He smacks his lips when he eats and he goes around here as if he owned the place.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I wouldn'teven shake hands with him if I weren't afraid of offending Eugenia.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I wouldn't want to influence you, but if I were you, I'd get rid of him.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How about throwing him down the stairs?

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
– Oh, that wouldn't really solve anything. – Or maybe a left hook right in the face?

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That’s not the core of the problem.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Just a small one right in the face? It couldn't do any harm.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If it's all right with you, I'll tell him to get ready for one.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
– May I take down the cage, Arthur? – Take it off, uncle, it doesn't matter.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Eddie is simple, yes, simple and very decent.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have never in all my years met a simpler man.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
– What's wrong with him? – I don't know. He just doesn't react anymore.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What are you whispering in his ear?

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Me? Nothing. I've just been telling him about the life of the bees.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Breakfast is ready.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Mother.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
– Could you let me have this until Tuesday? – I'm afraid not. I've got an exam on Monday.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Too bad. Some terrific pictures in here.

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thanks, mother.

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mother, get down off that thing, will you? You look like a character out of Edgar Allen Poe.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Out of what?

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, just lik e ... It's all so terribly old-fashioned.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But what will he say?

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He's drinking coffee now. He won't say anything.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Arthur, may I get down?

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's all the same to me. This coffee's bitter.

151
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We're all out of sugar. Eugene ate it.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I beg your pardon. All I ate was the jam. It was Eddie who ate up the sugar.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And blow those candles out, will you? We've got to economize.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who's winning?

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Eddie.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There is something positively unnatural about Edward's good luck.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
– Eddie, have you been cheating? – Me? Never.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But you promised you'd lose today. I need the money for groceries.

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Tough luck!

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I smelled coffee. Hello, Eddie.

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Good morning, sir.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I thought this was your day to sleep until noon. The bed will be occupied after lunch.

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't sleep. A new idea came to me. Who's drinking coffee anyway? Oh, it's you, Arthur ?

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
– Can't you at least button your pajamas? – What for?

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What for? What do you mean, what for?

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean: What for? Such a simple question and you can't find an answer.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because ... one just doesn't appear like that.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You see? Your answer is meaningless. It's pure convention.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It won't stand up under the scrutiny of the intellect.

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Isn't that enough?

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Not at all. Not for me. I'm the kind of man who goes deeper.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If we're going to discuss this, we've got to take the imponderables into account.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh Lord, Father, can't you button your fly first and then talk it over?

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That would be a complete reversal of the logical thought process.

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The effect would precede the cause.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Man should never act without thinking, never act like an automaton.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I take it then that you will not button your pajamas.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, son. Anyway, I can't. No buttons.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I might have expected as much.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Not at all. In this case at least, matter springs from the mind.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's precisely what I wanted to talk to you about, Father.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Later, boy. Later. Isn't anybody ever going to remove that thing?

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why?

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, I have nothing against it on purely formal grounds

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Actually it enriches reality, stimulates the imagination.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I could use the space for my experiments.

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But you've got the whole house.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'd be glad, too, if you got rid of it Then Arthur couldn't torture me.

189
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You see? What's going on in this house? Chaos, anarchy, entropy.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How long has it been since Grandfather died?

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Ten years!

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And all that time nobody's ever thought of riddling the house of that catafalque.

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Incredible! We should be grateful that you at least took Grandfather out of the house.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We couldn't keep him any longer.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm not interested in the details. It's the principle of the thing.

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Really?

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But it's not only Grandfather !

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was born twenty-five years ago and my baby carriage is still standing here.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why isn't it up in the attic? And what's this thing?

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Mother's wedding dress !

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why isn't it put away in a closet? And Uncle Eugene's riding breeches

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What are they lying around here for when the last horse he ever rode

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
died forty years ago?

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My dear.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No order, no sense of reality, no decency, no initiative.

206
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You can't move in this place, you can't breathe, you can't live!

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How beautifully you drink, Eddie!

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
My boy, tradition doesn't interest me in the slightest.Your indignation is absurd.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know very well we attach no importance to these monuments of the past,

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
these relics of family tradition.

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's why everything's lying around like this. We live in freedom.

212
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Where's my coffee?

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, no, Father, you just don't understand me. That's not what bothers me. No, that's not it.

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then kindly explain yourself more clearly, will you, boy? Isn't there any more coffee?

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No, there won't be any until the day after tomorrow.

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why the day after tomorrow?

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
How should I know?

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
All right, Never mind.

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Listen to me! It's not this particular tradition that bothers me.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a fact that in this family there’s no frame of reference at all.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
All that's left is bits and pieces, fragments, rubbish.

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You've destroyed everything but you go on destroying;

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you've gone on so long you've finally forgotten why you began in the first place.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He's right. Stomil, do you still remember how we shattered tradition?

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How, in protest against tradition, I gave myself to you with Mummy

226
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and Daddy looking on? In the first row of the orchestra

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
at the opening night of Tannhauser.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What a gorgeous scandal that was!

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where are the days when people were still shocked by such things?

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And then you proposed to me.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
As I recall it was at the National Museum's first avantgarde exhibition.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The critics gave us rave reviews.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No. It was at the opera. At the exhibition it wasn't you, or maybe it wasn't me.

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're getting everything mixed up.

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The days of revolt, the time of the great leap forward.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Liberation from the fetters of the old art and the old way of life.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Man coming into his own, man overthrowing the old gods and putting himself on the pedestal.

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The seed burst open, the chains snapped.

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Revolution and release. That was our slogan then.

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Away with outmoded forms, down with convention! Long live the dynamic!

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Life as creation, an incessant striving toward new frontiers

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Movement and struggle! All form transcended!

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Stomil! You've been drinking at the fountain of youth! I hardly recognize you.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes, we were young once.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What do you mean? We haven't grown any older. We've never betrayed our ideals.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why, even now our motto is still: Forward! Ever forward!

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes. Yes. Forward!

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Do we have any prejudices? Do conventions mean anything to us?

249
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Aren't we still fighting against the old? Aren't we free?

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The old what?

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, the old times. Don't you remember?

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't tell me you've forgotten what we were just talking about?

253
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
All those fetters, those rusty chains of religion, morality, society, art.

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Especially art, Stomil. Art!

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, of course. But when was all that actually?

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Just a minute. Let me figure it out. We were married in 1900…

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
no, just let me thin ... Arthur was born i n...

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We're young. Eternally young .. .

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
– Father's right. – What do you mean?

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's all dead and gone now. All in the past.

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's gone?

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The shackles, the religion, the morals, the handcuffs, the carcasses and so on!

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're all gone now, unfortunately.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Unfortunately? You don't know what you're saying. If you'd lived in those days,

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you'd know how much we've done for you.

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You have no idea what the world was like then.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can you imagine how much courage it took to dance the tango?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Do you realize that in those days there were hardly any fallen women?

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That the only recognized style of painting was naturalism?

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That the theater was utterly bourgeois? Stifling.

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You couldn't even put your elbows down on the dinner table!

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I can still remember a youth demonstration. It wasn't until after nineteen …

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
…I don’t know when… the most advanced spirits

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
stopped giving up their seats to elderly people.

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, we didn't spare ourselves in our struggle for these rights and if you

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
today can push your grandmother around, its to us your thanks are due.

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You simply can't imagine how much you owe us.

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
To think how we struggled to give you

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
this freedom which you now despise!

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What did you produce? This bawdyhouse where  nothing works because

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
everyone can do what he pleases, where there are no laws and no violations?

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I know only one law: Don't hesitate, do what you feel like.

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Every man is entitled to his own kind of happiness.

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Stomil, I've got it! I've figured it out! It was 1968.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What was?

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've forgotten.

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You've poisoned the generations before you and after you with your freedom.

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Look at Grandmother! She's completely addled. Haven't you noticed?

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I just knew he'd drag me into it.

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There's nothing wrong with Mama. What do you mean?

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Naturally you're not shocked by her senile demoralization.

292
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Once she was a dignified, self-respecting grandmother. And now?

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Now she plays poker with Eddie!

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I beg your pardon. We also play bridge, you know.

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I wasn't talking to you.

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Each has the right to do what he wants and with whomever he chooses.

297
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Old people too.

298
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's not a right. It's a moral obligation to be immoral.

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You astonish me. Your opinions are so terribly outdated.

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
When we were your age, we considered every kind of conformity disgraceful.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Rebellion! Rebellion alone had any value for us.

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What value?

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
A dynamic and therefore positive value,

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
though sometimes in a negative way.

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I trust you don't think we were merely blind anarchists? Right, Eleonora?

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Not?

307
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We were a column marching off to the future, a movement, a historical process.

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Rebellion is the rock on which progress builds its temple.

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Believe me: the scope of our rebellion was prodigious.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The greater the scope of the rebellion the grander the temple will be.

311
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The larger the area covered by the rebellion,

312
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
the more spacious the building will be.

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And believe me, we've prepared the ground for a good chunk of it.

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you too are trying to do something constructive, why can't we build together?

315
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Impossible. Let’s start this over.

316
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What I said just now was purely objective. I described our historical role,

317
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but said nothing of our intentions.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We have always pursued our own inclinations. Haven’t we, Eleonora?

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes.

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But by opposing everything, we paved the way for the future.

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What future?

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's not my affair. My job was to shatter existing forms.

323
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In other words, we're still enemies?

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
– Eddie, Eddie! – Coming, granny.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why take it so tragically? All you need to do is stop worrying about principles.

326
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I wonder why you, the youngest of us all, should be the one to harp on principles.

327
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It used to be the other way around.

328
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Because I'm starting out in the world. But what a world!

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If I want a world, I've got to make one.

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't you want to be modern? At your age?

331
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's just the point. Be modern. Even Grandmother has grown old

332
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
in this world that has lost its standards.

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That’s how modern your era is. What's more, you've grown old in it.

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I should like to call your attention to certain achievements,

335
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
for instance, the right to wear short pants… the fresh feel of the breeze ...

336
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, keep quiet, Uncle. Don't you realize that,

337
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
because everything is possible.

338
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The whole thing is absurd.

339
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
– What do you want then? Tradition? – An orderly world!

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's all?

341
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
…and the right to rebel.

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's it. That's what I've been telling you all along:

343
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't you see that you've deprived me of every last chance to revolt?

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You've been nonconformists so long that there aren't any conventions left

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
to rebel against. You've left nothing for me nothing!

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Your only norm is the absence of all norms.

347
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The only thing left for me to rebel against is you.

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Go right ahead. Did I ever tell you not to?

349
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's the stuff, Arthur. You'll show them.

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Maybe it would calm you down. You’re so tense nowadays.

351
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
– Impossible! – Why?

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Rebel against you? What are you anyway?

353
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
A formless mass, an amorphous blob, an atomized world, a mob without shape

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
or structure. Your world can't even be blown up; it’s disintegraged all by itself.

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
– You mean we're no good for anything? – Exactly.

356
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But couldn't you just try?

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There's nothing to try. It's hopeless. You're all so disgustingly tolerant.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes, that could be irritating, I suppose.

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Still, I don't like to see you feeling so left out.

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You mustn't think your mother's heart is made of stone.

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We all love you, Arthur. We want to help you.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's hopeless.

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This nonconformism you're pushing me into is only a new kind of conformism.

364
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I can't be a conformist forever.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I’ve got an age. My friends are all laughing at me.

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But what about art, Arthur? Art?

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Exactly. You've taken the words out of my mouth.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What art?

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, art in general. I've devoted my whole life to art.

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Art is eternal rebellion. Why don't you give it a try?

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Father, you bore me. I want to be a doctor !

372
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A disgrace to the whole family! I've always dreamed of his becoming an artist.

373
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
When I was carrying him in my womb, I ran through the woods naked, singing Bach.

374
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
All for nothing!

375
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Maybe you sang out of tune , Mother .

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
All the same, don't give up hope. You still don't understand the value of art.

377
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've just had an idea for a new experiment.

378
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Eugenia, Eddie. Stomil has come up with something new.

379
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Again?

380
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes. It came to me this morning. It's absolutely original.

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You'll put it on right away, won't you, Stomil?

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm ready.

383
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Heaven help us!

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Eugene, move the table. Make room.

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Where am I? First all that shouting and now they're moving furniture...

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What time is it anyway?

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I forgot to tell you, Ala has been here since six o'clock this morning.

388
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Ala, you're just in time for the show.

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But why didn't you tell me? If I'd known, I'd have kept them quiet.

390
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Eddie , f ace to the wall !

391
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Did you sleep well?

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So so.

393
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
How long can you stay?

394
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't know. I told Mother I might never go back.

395
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
– And what did she say? – Nothing. She wasn't there.

396
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Then how could you tell her?

397
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Maybe I didn't. I don't remember.

398
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
– You've forgotten? – It was so long ago.

399
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
How about some breakfast? Oh! We're out of coffee.

400
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
MayI sit beside you?

401
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why not?

402
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're very lovely. What are you laughing about?

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
– Me? Laughing? I'm not laughing. – But you were.

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Are you trying to pick a fight?

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
– I've been thinking about you a lot, Ala. – Go on.

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
– I thought about meeting you! – Go on.

407
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
– And sitting down beside yo ... – Go on.

408
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
–. .. and talking with you . -Go on.

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
– ... about one thing and another ... – Go on.

410
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
– About different kinds of things. – Go on! Go on!

411
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
– Would you marry me? – Go on.

412
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What's wrong with you?

413
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What do you want anyway?

414
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's what they all keep asking me.

415
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Never mind. I don't need to know.

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Kindly take your seats. T ake your seats.

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Eddie, where are you going?

418
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Be back in a minute .. .

419
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You stay right here!

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Arthur, Ala, what are you doing? We're waiting for you.

421
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Experimental theatre . My father’s obsession.

422
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen ... the heroes of the play: Adam and Eve in paradise !

423
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
– We've had that. – When?

424
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
At the beginning of the world.

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That was the old version. This is a new one.

426
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Where's the snake?

427
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Shhh!

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The snake is in our imagination. We all know the story.

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Attention! Here we go!

430
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So I'm Adam and I’m in Paradise.

431
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And before me lies a world of possibilities.

432
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But now it starts. From Adam's bone Eve steps upon the earth.

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
To what will shegive birth? Destiny, 'tis known to you alone.

434
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Adam was first, but he did not exist until I also came to be.

435
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He walks so proudly still. Doesn't the poor man see for all his intellection ...

436
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That there is no perfection Except in what is not?

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Where does the darkness go When the sun comes out?

438
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Well, what do you say? Not bad, eh?

439
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Stomil, you frightened us so!

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Every experiment must shock. T hat's my first principle.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
If that's what you were after, it was a success all right. My heart's still pounding.

442
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
How did you do it, Stomil?

443
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I blew the fuse and fired the revolver.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
– Marvelous! – What’s marvelous in that?

445
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
– Don't you understand? – No, I don' t.

446
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Don't mind him, Stomil. Eugene has always been slow.

447
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
– How about you, Eugenia – Huh?

448
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Did you understand the experiment, Grandmother ?

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
– What? – It has made her deaf.

450
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That doesn't surprise me.

451
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let me explain. The shock method creates

452
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
an immediate unity of action and perception. See?

453
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
– Yes, but… – Yes, but what?

454
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But what's that got to do with Adam and Eve?

455
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Eugene, do try to concentrate !

456
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What we are dealing with here is a theatrical phenomenon, the dynamics of perception.

457
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I highlight the dynamics of the sexual fact. That means something to you, doesn't it?

458
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Frankly, I don't think it does.

459
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I give up !

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh God! Who's going to experiment if you lose heart?

461
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
A flop, friends !

462
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I prefer the movies !

463
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well, now what should we do?

464
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Clear out! All of you. Out!

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
What's got into you?

466
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
All of you! I can't bear the sight of you !

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Is that a way to treat your own father?

468
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I used to have a father. Not anymore ! I'll have to make myself a father !

469
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You? You make me?

470
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You and the whole lot of you. I'm going to make you all over.

471
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And now get out. This minute!

472
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That boy's going just a bit too far.

473
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Never mind, Stomil. Thank God, we're enlightened.

474
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You think I should really go?

475
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Why not? You're not really interested in anything but your experiments.

476
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Ah yes, art! Modern art! Give me God and I'll make an experiment out of Him.

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You see ...

478
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
G et out !

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Come on.

480
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't forget the cards!

481
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Arthur, If you need anything…

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Get out!

483
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You're absolutely right, Arthur. Between you and me, they're a bad lot.

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You too. Out!

485
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Certainly. Certainly. I'm going.

486
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I only wanted to tell you that you can count on me.

487
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What do you mean?

488
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Never mind. Just do what you think right.

489
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But remember. I can be useful to you. I'm not as far gone as the rest of them.

490
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm an old-timer.

491
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Good .

492
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm an old-timer.

493
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But now leave me alone, will you?

494
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Reform.

495
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Rebirth.

496
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Now I'll explain everything.

497
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What do you want to say?

498
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Shh… quiet.

499
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Why?

500
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You think they care what we do.

501
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
We could climb up the walls and sleep on the ceiling for all they care.

502
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What's wrong?

503
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Stomil pinched me twice today.

504
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
– The rotte r! – H e's your father!

505
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Thank you for reminding me.

506
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It sounds so old-fashioned, nobody calls his father a rotter nowadays.

507
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
– What do you call him then? – Nothing. You just ignore him.

508
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then I was mistaken.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, it's your headache that he's your father. Personally, I think he's great.

510
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
– An artist! – What's wrong with that?

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Artists are a plague. They were the first to contaminate our society.

512
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, who cares? What did you want me for? It's cold in here. I'm practically naked.

513
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Hadn't you noticed?

514
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Well, what do you say? Have you thought it over?

515
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You mean will I marry you? But I've already told you. I don't see the point.

516
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You mean the answer is no?

517
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Why do you get so worked up about it?

518
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I mean--I don't care--if it means so much to you, we can get married tomorrow.

519
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We're already cousins.

520
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But I want you to care!

521
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I want you to realize that marriage is something very important.

522
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Important? Why? I don't get it.

523
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If I'm going to have a baby it'll be with you, not with the minister.

524
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So what's the problem?

525
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, if it's not important in itself, then we've got to make it important.

526
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What for?

527
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
We derive pleasure from profit and we only profit from doing things we

528
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
attach importance to--difficult things, the unusual things that seem rare and precious.

529
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And that's why we have to create a system of values.

530
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Philosophy bores me. I think I prefer Stomil.

531
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You only think that. Kindly remove that leg.

532
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You don't like it?

533
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
That has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject.

534
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Don’t you like it?

535
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, all right, show your leg if you want to.

536
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Anyway, your leg only proves my point.

537
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
My leg?

538
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yes. Do you know why you're showing your leg?

539
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Because I don't leap all over you like my artist father and everybody else does.

540
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That worries you. You were pretty bewildered this morning when

541
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
we were all alone. You thought you knew what I wanted from you.

542
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
That's not true.

543
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Not true? Ha. You think I didn't see how upset you were

544
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
when I proposed marriage instead of just picking you up

545
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and throwing you down on the bed?

546
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I had a headache.

547
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Headache? Go on. You just couldn't figure out what was going on.

548
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
T hat you must be losing your charms.

549
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
If I suddenly started acting like my father, it would be a relief, wouldn't it?

550
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Yes. Except you'd run away, just to get even with me.

551
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm running all right.

552
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Sit down. I haven't finished yet.

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
All you care about is your sex appeal. You're so primitive.

554
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You can't think about anything else. You don't know anything else!

555
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Are you suggesting that I'm backward?

556
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
– Don't be angry. – What?

557
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Aren't you too warm in that blanket?

558
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No.

559
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Uncle Eugene's hat doesn't look very good on you.

560
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I don't care.

561
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Without the right kind of values we can never hope to create a harmonious world

562
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
or establish the necessary balance between those elements commonly termed good and evil

563
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
--though of course I use these words in their larger rather than strictly ethical sense.

564
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We must, one, restore the practical relevance of these concepts and,

565
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Secundo… I have to create the rules of action .

566
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Arthur, what are you doing?

567
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh, do excuse me !

568
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Eddie, what are you doing here?

569
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I was just going to the kitchen for water, pardon, I didn't know you were conversing.

570
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
– Water? Water? What for? – Because I'm thirsty, sir.

571
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
At this hour? In the middle of the night?

572
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
If that's the way you feel about it, I can go without.

573
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Drink and get out!

574
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
As you wish.

575
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Hey!

576
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Yes, sir?

577
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
– The kitchen is on the right. – Impossible.

578
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I believe I know where the kitchen is in my own house.

579
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You just can't be sure of anything these days.

580
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
That idiot! I'll have to take care of him once and for all.

581
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Have you finished taking care of me?

582
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's all his fault !

583
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I suppose it was his fault you nearly twisted my arm off.

584
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Does it hurt very much?

585
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What do you care?

586
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
– Where does it hurt? – Here ...

587
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
– I'm terribly sorry. – …and here .. .

588
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
– Really, I didn't mean to. – …and here ...

589
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Forgive me. I didn't mean to ...

590
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Now you've shown what you really are a brute. First a lot of talk and then the usual.

591
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We poor women! Is it our fault we have bodies?

592
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If we could only check them somewhere like a hat or a coat. ..

593
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Then maybe we'd be safe from out sweet-talking cousins.

594
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Frankly, I'm surprised. You with your noble ideals.

595
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But really, I…

596
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
No excuses! You don't think I like a good conversation too?

597
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Calmly, without worrying that philosophers will come crawling to my feet.

598
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But never mind. What were we talking about? It was just beginning to be interesting .

599
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Do you seriously think I wanted to rape you?

600
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Didn't you?

601
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Certainly not. I was only teaching you a lesson.

602
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Thanks. I know that subject.

603
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You can only think about one thing. Then why did you resist?

604
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You're vulgar.

605
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Science knows no shame. Why?

606
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
– Well, why did you attack me? – I was sacrificing myself.

607
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
What?

608
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes, sacrificing myself in my effort to make certain things clear to you.

609
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It was a pure exercise in sexual pragmatics.

610
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Pig ! Scientific pig! Pragmatics? What is it anyway?

611
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Some new kind of perversion?

612
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
There's nothing new about it. Women will follow me.

613
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Which women?

614
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
All women. Women throughout the world will be my allies.

615
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And once the women are convinced,

616
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
the men will soon come around.

617
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
What women? Anybody I know? Anyway, do what you like with them. I don't care.

618
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Look. The central fact of history is the total enslavement

619
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Of women, children and artists by men.

620
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I thought you didn't approve of artists.

621
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That's beside the point. Men don't like artists is that artists aren't men.

622
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And that’s exactly what has always brought them closer to women—unfortunately.

623
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
They are generally unfamiliar with concepts like honor, logic, and progress—

624
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
everything men have invented.

625
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
The male half of humanity only realized, and only after great effort and much delay,

626
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
that ambiguity, relativity, and oblivion also exist. As well as fleeting illusions.

627
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
All of this stands in stark contrast to what man, with his hardened boxer’s skull,

628
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
imagined at the dawn of time, what he wrote on his banners, and tried for centuries to force

629
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
upon women, children, and artists. He created a world in his own image and likeness.

630
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The result was that, in self defense, women, children and artists

631
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
closed ranks to form a single community...

632
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Sorry. What’s he doing?

633
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Maybe he's washing.

634
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Him? Not likely! Let's get back to the subject.

635
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I just don't believe you. I see what you're getting at. You can't fool me.

636
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm simply trying to make you aware of your own interests as a woman.

637
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I want to enlighten you.

638
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
What does that mean? You want me to strip?

639
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Oh, don't be tedious. Once you've finally come to see that

640
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
our interests coincide, you'll be willing to work with me.

641
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What do men want? They want to abolish all conventions relating to sex. And why?

642
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
To make life easier for them, to do away with all barriers between desire and satisfaction

643
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It’s the in-between that annoys them.

644
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That’s true. They throw themselves at us like animals.

645
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I’ve just experienced it myself.

646
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I can't deny that as an individual I'm subject to natural drives.

647
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But I have a higher goal.

648
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Generally speaking, men have done everything they could to do away with

649
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
the last remaining rules governing sexual behavior.

650
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I can't believe that women really like it,

651
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and that's the basis of my plan.

652
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
– I like it fine. – That's a lie. You can’t.

653
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yes, I like it. It means I'm free, I can do as I please.

654
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
For instance, if I take my clothes off right now, what can you do about it?

655
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Stop it. This is a serious discussion.

656
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Why should I? Who's going to stop me? You? My mother? God?

657
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Cover yourself this minute!

658
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I will not.

659
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh, hi, Eddie. Come on in !

660
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Get out or I'll kill you.

661
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Sorry, I thought you’re only having a conversation.

662
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Taking your clothes off in front of this… Have you no shame?

663
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He may not be very cultured, but he has marvellous eyes.

664
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Eyes like a pig.

665
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
– I like them. – I'll kill him.

666
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
– Are you jealous? – I'm not.

667
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
First he's brutal. Then he's jealous. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

668
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Go on then. Undress! I'm not stopping you.

669
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I don't feel like it anymore.

670
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
– Suit yourself. – I've changed my mind.

671
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, you don't. Tell me, why don't you want to anymore!

672
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Tell me why you wanted to before.

673
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
My God, what a lunatic!

674
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Why?

675
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
– I don't know. – Tell me!

676
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What should I say? I don't know,I just don't know.

677
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Good. It's because you only pretend to like all this absence of rules,

678
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This debauchery, this promiscuity.

679
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh, I only pretend, do I?

680
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Of course. You really hate it, because it's not to your advantage.

681
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This lack of forms and norms cuts down your freedom of choice.

682
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
There's nothing left for you to do but take off your clothes

683
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and put them back on again.

684
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
– That's not true. – Then why this sudden modesty?

685
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Now you're being logical. You just said that logic was nonsense.

686
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I said that?

687
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes, only a minute ago. I heard you.

688
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You must have heard wrong.

689
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I heard you quite clearly.

690
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Doesn’t matter. But I still don't believe you. I'm convinced that the convention

691
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
of unconventionality goes against your grain. You didn't make it up.

692
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Who did then?

693
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We, men! You only pretend to like it. And now you're stuck with it,

694
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and nobody likes to admit he's just following the herd.

695
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Come on.  I simply refuse to believe that you want to go to bed

696
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
with every man in the world.

697
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Let’s say you choose for yourself the best—

698
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
one hundred, two hundred, ten thousand, a million, perhaps.

699
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
But certainly not all of them. You want to be desired by everyone, yes, of course—

700
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
that’s different. But you want that so you can exercise the power to choose.

701
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And outside of convention, what real power of selection does a woman have? What?

702
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
– I'm free. I know exactly what I want. – But you're weak by nature.

703
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
As much as you don't want to give in to me, if Edek hadn't come in,

704
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you would have had no escape. I'm stronger than you.

705
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I could always take up judo.

706
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It was a metaphor. Can't you women ever understand a general idea?

707
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Lots of girls study judo. I'd have you begging for mercy !

708
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Excellent. You're getting there. Why does it have to be judo

709
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
when conventions are quite effective?

710
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I'd be kneeling at your feet with a bouquet in my hand begging you

711
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
to take pity on me, to grant me a ray of hope.

712
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Behind a solid wall of conventions, without any wrestling,

713
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
without even getting your hair mussed, you'd have me at your mercy.

714
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Wouldn't that be better than judo?

715
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
– Really? Down on your knees? – Yes.

716
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
-Okay. Go ahead. -What?

717
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
– Down on your knees. – Impossible.

718
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Why?

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Because there are no conventions left. Now do you see what a fix you're in?

720
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
– There’s nothing we can do about it? – It is.

721
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
What?

722
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Establish new conventions or bring back the old ones.

723
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And that's exactly what I'm going to do with your help.

724
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Everything's prepared. All I need is your help.

725
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Great! And you'll really get down on your knees?

726
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I will.

727
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Now what can I do to help?

728
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Marry me. That's the first step. No more promiscuity, no more dolce vita.

729
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
A real marriage. Not just dropping into city hall

730
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
between breakfast and lunch.

731
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A genuine wedding with all the ceremony with

732
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
an organ playing and bridesmaids and so on.

733
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm especially counting on the procession. It will take them by surprise.

734
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Important is from then on, they won't have time to think, to organize resistance

735
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And spread defeatism. It's the first shot that counts.

736
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Catching them off guard like that, we can force them to accept conventions

737
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
they'll never breakout of again.

738
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's going to be the kind of wedding they'll have

739
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
to take part in, and on my terms.

740
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll turn them into a bridal procession,

741
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and at long last my father will be forced to button his fly.

742
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
What do you say?

743
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And I'll get to wear a white wedding gown?

744
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
White as snow. Everything strictly according to the rules. And at the same time

745
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
you'll be helping all the women in the world.

746
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The rebirth of convention will set them free.

747
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
– Was somebody listening? – No.

748
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I had the feeling there was.

749
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Let's settle this matter once and for all. Do you consent?

750
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't know yet.

751
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
– I haven't convinced you? – You had.

752
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
– So? Do you consent? – No...

753
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
– Yes or no? – I have to think about it.

754
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But what is there to think about? It's as plain as day.

755
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I've got to rebuild a world, and for that I must have a wedding.

756
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's perfectly simple. What don't you understand?

757
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
– The whole thing, I guess. – What do you mean?

758
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Wait…

759
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
No, I can't wait. There just isn't time. I'll stay here while you go think it over.

760
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
When you've made up your mind, come back and give me your answer.

761
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It's sure to be yes. I've explained everything.

762
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And you really have nothing else you want to tell me?

763
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Run along now. I'll see you later.

764
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
You're throwing me out?

765
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No, I have a little private business to attend to.

766
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Can't I stay?

767
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No this is a family matter.

768
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
All right. Then I'll have my little secrets too. You’ll see.

769
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yes, yes, but run along now.

770
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
– Who's there? – Me.

771
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
– Which me? – Your uncle, Eugene.

772
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
– Password? – Reform. Answer?

773
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Rebirth. All right. Enter, uncle.

774
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oof. I'm exhausted.

775
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Is everything ready?

776
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I've brought everything I could down from the attic. You should see the moths!

777
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You think, it will work?

778
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's got to work.

779
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm worried, worried. They're so demoralized. Think of it. A whole lifetime

780
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
in this bawdy-house... Pardon, I meant this atmosphere of moral disintegration.

781
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
You see, it's contagious. Forgive me.

782
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Forget it. What's my father doing?

783
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
He's in his room, working on a new theatre experiment.

784
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Don't you feel sorry for him sometimes, Arthur?

785
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
After all, he actually believes in that art of his.

786
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Then why do you discourage him?

787
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
For spite. To get his goat. But the fact is,

788
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
those experiments of his don't mean a thing to me. Do you believe in them?

789
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I've got other problems. And Mother?

790
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Can’t see a thing. Either she's turned off the lights, or she's drawn the curtains.

791
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And Grandmother Eugenia?

792
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Probably sitting at her mirror, putting on makeup.

793
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Good. You may go now, uncle.

794
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Any further orders?

795
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Be vigilant. Eyes open, mouth shut, and ready for action.

796
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
God protect you, Arthur.

797
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Maybe we'll manage to bring the good old days back again yet.

798
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
– Who's there? – Me. Arthur.

799
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
– What do you want? – Father, I've got to talk to you.

800
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
At this time of night? I'm busy. Come back tomorrow.

801
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It's urgent.

802
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But I've already told you, I'm busy. You can speak to me tomorrow.

803
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
What are you doing, father? Stop it! Father, father…

804
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Are you mad? What's going on?

805
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Not so loud.

806
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Why aren't you in bed?

807
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I can't sleep. It's time to take action.

808
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
In that case, good night.

809
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I only wanted to ask you, Father, doesn't it bother you?

810
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
– What? – This thing with Eddie.

811
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Eddie? Oh yes, I remember the man.

812
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
– What do you think of him? – He's amusing.

813
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Amusing? He's repulsive.

814
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You’re exaggerating. Eddie's an unusual type.

815
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
From a point of view, he’s expectionally modern.

816
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
A very modern, authentic type.

817
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That’s all?

818
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You see, our trouble is that we're still too conscious, too cerebral.

819
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Enslaved by centuries of culture. Of course we've been doing our best

820
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
to throw culture off, but we're still a long way from nature.

821
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Eddie was born the way we all ought to be.

822
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What comes to him as an innate trait, we can only achieve

823
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
through great effort and artistry.

824
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That’s why he interests me —as an artist.

825
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I regard him the way a landscape painter regards the landscape."

826
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Some landscape!

827
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
There's been a complete revolution in aesthetics and morality.

828
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
You keep making me remind you of things that ought to be self-evident.

829
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
If Eddie shocks us now and then, it's because we're decadent.

830
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Sometimes I can't help feeling guilty toward Eddie. But I fight it down.

831
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
– And that's all you have to say? – I've been perfectly frank with you.

832
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Then I'll have to start all over again. Why do you tolerate him in your house?

833
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Why not?

834
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He enriches our environment, he gives it a new 'tone,

835
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
he adds a dash of authenticity. He even stimulates my imagination.

836
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
We artists need an exotic touch now and then.

837
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
– Then you really don't know? – No, I don't know a thing.

838
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You're lying. You know perfectly well.

839
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I repeat--I don't know. I don't want to know.

840
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
He sleeps with Mother.

841
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
What’s your opinion, Father?

842
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Let’s admit you’re right , Father .

843
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Sexual freedom is the cornerstone of human freedom.

844
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
What do you say to that?

845
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But it's the truth! They do sleep together!

846
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I said we'd assume it's true. What follows? Nothing.

847
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Then you insist on treating it as an abstract hypothesis?

848
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So youáre stubbornly insisting that this is nothing more than an abstract hypothesis,

849
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
a wordplay, a product of intellectual imagination?

850
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Why not? I'm no old-fashioned stiff. On an intellectual level,

851
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I’m willing to accept any premise— no matter how delicate or absurd.

852
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
This is not an intellectual premise. This is the truth.

853
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Do you understand, Father? This is life.

854
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The fact remains: you wear horns. Horns that scrape the ceiling.

855
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Horns, horns! That’s a banal metaphor,

856
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
not the tool of sober intellectual analysis.

857
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Let’s not lower our standards!

858
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Father, you're a cuckold.

859
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Hold your tongue. I forbid you to talk to me like that.

860
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
You can't stop me. You're a cuckold.

861
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I can't believe it.

862
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Ha! Now I've got you where I want you. Want me to prove it? Open her door.

863
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
No!

864
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Are you afraid? Of course it's easier to perform theoretical experiments.

865
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
When it comes to experiments you're a giant.

866
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
In real life you're a midget.

867
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Me? Midget?

868
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
A hero in pajamas! A pintsized Agamemnon!

869
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'll show you. You say they're in there?

870
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Look for yourself.

871
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'll show them. I'll show you. I'll show the whole lot of you!

872
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'll take care of this whole thing tomorrow.

873
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Or you know whatI'll do?

874
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Tomorrow! Or by mail. A letter. What do you say?

875
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Phoney!

876
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What did you say?

877
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
– Here I g o! – Just a second. ..

878
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Let me at them.

879
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
– You'd better take this. – What's that?

880
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
You can't go in there bare-handed.

881
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Now I see through you.

882
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Get in there! There's not a minute to lose.

883
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Now I understand. You want a tragedy!

884
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
A tragedy? What do you…

885
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So that's what you're after, you dim little runt of a brainstorm, you…

886
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
What are you trying…

887
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You want me to kill him? And then her? And then myself? Right?

888
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The injured husband wiping out his shame in blood.

889
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Where do you get such ideas? From romantic novels?

890
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Father, you know I never .

891
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I always knew the younger generation cared more about ideas than life,

892
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
but I never expected my own son to sacrifice his father to an idea.

893
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Sit down! And now let’s talk.

894
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
You want to bring back the old values. What for? Well, never mind that.

895
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That's your business. I've let you talk, I've heard you out

896
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
but now you're going just a bit too far.

897
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
How fiendishly clever! So you need a tragedy!

898
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Tragedy has always been the most perfect expression of a society with established values.

899
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Instead of the art form you wanted the thing itself.

900
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Or, never mind if somebody's killed, never mind if your own father goes off to prison.

901
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
No, all you care about is your idea.

902
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
You could do with a tragedy, couldn't you?

903
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Do you want to know what I think of you? A vulgar formalist.

904
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Your mother mean nothing to you. We can all die as long as form wins out.

905
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
And the worst of it is that you don't even care about yourself. You're a fanatic!

906
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Maybe my motives aren't as formal as you think.

907
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
– You dislike Eddie? – I hate him.

908
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Why? Eddie is necessity.

909
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
He's the pure truth we've been searching for so long because

910
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
we always thought it was somewhere else.

911
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Eddie is a fact. You can't hate facts. You've got to accept them.

912
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You cannot hate what is factual. You have to love it.

913
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
What? Should I kneel before him? I shall create the necessity.

914
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Good Lord. You talk like a petulant child.

915
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
He doesn’t like him… If that’s the case, I can only see one explanation.

916
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It’s all clear! Maybe you've got an Oedipus.

917
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
A what?

918
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
An Oedipus complex, understand? Have you consulted an analyst?

919
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
No. Mother's wonderful, but that's not it.

920
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Too bad. Then at least we'd know where we were at.

921
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Anything is better than sheer lunacy. I guess you're just a formalist.

922
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I am not.

923
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh yes you are. And an insufferable and dangerous one at that.

924
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It may look that way to you, but the truth is that I just can't go on like this.

925
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I can't live with you people.

926
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I see. That's more like it. In other words, you're an egoist.

927
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Call it whatever you like.

928
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Sacrificing myself - what good would that do you?

929
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Something would be accomplished.

930
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Tragedy is a form so vast and powerful that reality

931
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
can never escape its grip.

932
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You poor devil. You really believe that?

933
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Suppose I actually killed him. What would be the good of it?

934
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It would be something irrevocable, masterful, classical.

935
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Not for a minute. It would be a farce. In our time only farce is possible.

936
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Farse can be also be artistically beautiful!

937
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
– Not for me. – Lord, you can be stubborn!

938
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I can't help it. I've got to find a way out.

939
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
– Regardless of reality? – Yes. At any cost.

940
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
That's not so easy. I'd like to help you, but I don't see how.

941
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Couldn't we give it a try?

942
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Give what a try?

943
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
With them…

944
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You still have illusions?

945
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Even if you're right about farce…

946
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
It's only because you people are such cowards.

947
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
You complain, but you're stuck in a farce.

948
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Because no one has the courage to rebel.

949
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
To tell you the truth, I don't much care for this kind of thing either.

950
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
In fact, I detest it. Only the more I think about it, the less I know why.

951
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So if I could convince you…

952
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'd be very grateful.

953
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And you'd…

954
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Go in and make a scene they'd remember as long as they lived.

955
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
But I need a rational justification.

956
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Believe it or not, nothing would please me more than to settle his hash.

957
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Except that my reason doesn't tell me why.

958
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Father, let me hug you. To hell with reason!

959
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
What have we got to lose? If the worst comes to the worse, you'll shoot him.

960
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Think so? If I could only be sure.

961
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Certainty comes later. The main thing now is to make up your mind.

962
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Hm. Maybe you're right…

963
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I know I'm right. You'll see. We'll have our tragedy!

964
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You've given me back my strength. The enthusiasm of youth untrammeled

965
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
by the skepticism of the times. Ah, youth, youth!

966
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Shall we go in?

967
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yes. With you beside me, I feel better.

968
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Just one more thing. Give up those experiments of yours, will you?

969
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
They only speed up the process of disintegration.

970
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Well, but what can we do? Tragedy impossible, farce a bore--

971
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
what's left but experiments?

972
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They only make things worse. Give them up.

973
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I don't know…

974
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Promise.

975
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
– Later. Now we go in. – I’ll stay at the door and wait here.

976
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
If you need any help, just shout.

977
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
If anybody yells, it'll be him, not me.

978
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Father, I've always had confidence in you.

979
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I believe you. I was the best shot in my regiment. Farewell!

980
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
No, that's the kitchen.

981
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I could use a drink.

982
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Later. When it's all over. No time now.

983
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Right! I'll kill him on the spot. That scoudrel! Now he's going to pay!

984
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
What's Eddie doing here? Why isn't Eddie?

985
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Shhhl Take it easy, boy!

986
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, it's you, Arthur? Are you still up?

987
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I told you he'd find us. He sticks his nose into everything.

988
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Father… You… with them!

989
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
That's how it worked out. It's not my fault.

990
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Stomil turned up just in time. We needed a fourth.

991
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Father, how could you…

992
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I told you it would end in a farce.

993
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Your play, Mr. Stomil. What you got?

994
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Here you are. A harmless pastime. You see the situation. What could I do?

995
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But, Father, you promised!

996
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I promised nothing. We'll just have to wait.

997
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Stomil, don’t talk, concentrate.

998
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Shame!

999
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I simply can't play under these conditions.

1000
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Can't anybody throw this little twerp out of here?

1001
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Easy, Grandma. Take it easy.

1002
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Arthur, you ought to be ashamed, upsetting your grandmother like this.

1003
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I told you we should lock the door.

1004
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
He can’t wait for some way to pester me. He'll put me back up on the catafalque!

1005
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Oh, no he won't! We've got to finish this rubber first.

1006
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
– Stop it! – But we've just started.

1007
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Arthur! You'd better listen to your mother.

1008
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
She's right. Look at the score cards, they're practically blank.

1009
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Now you listen to me! I've got something to tell you. Now! This minute!

1010
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
But Arthur, that was strictly between the two of us. Don't shout it from the rooftops.

1011
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I pleaded with you. You wouldn't listen. Now I'm going to use force. Stop the game!

1012
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
What's going on?

1013
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
What's got into you anyway? If I were your father, I'd give you a good hiding.

1014
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You shut up. Father, the revolver.

1015
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
A revolver? I don’t know what you’re talking abput.

1016
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
A guy can still make a joke, can't he?

1017
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
A revolver? For God's sake, Stomil, don't give it to him.

1018
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Talk to him. Do something. After all, you re his father.

1019
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Now see here, Arthur, you're not a child. I'm sorry to have to speak to you like this,

1020
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but out of consideration for mom...

1021
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
He's gone mad. Stomil, why on earth did you make this child? Criminal negligence!

1022
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
You pretend you don’t know?

1023
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Look here, Mr. Arthur…

1024
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Silence! Into the living room, everybody.

1025
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'll talk to you later.

1026
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
What's wrong? I did my best.

1027
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Your best!

1028
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I did everything I could to quiet him down. You saw me.

1029
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Idiot. And you call yourself a father. Oh, if I were only a manl

1030
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
That's easier said than done. You know it’s not possible.

1031
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Has it started yet?

1032
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Not yet. I'm still waiting for an answer.

1033
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I thought it had started. I heard a noise and I came running.

1034
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That's all right. I'm glad you've come. Stay here and keep an eye on them.

1035
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I'll be back in a second.

1036
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Am I dreaming?

1037
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Don't let anybody make a move.

1038
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Yes, sir.

1039
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's a plot! Mama, your brother's a gangster!

1040
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Eugene, do put that thing away.

1041
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
People don't play cowboys at your age.

1042
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Stay where you are!

1043
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Eugene, it's me—your sister Eugenia.

1044
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
When I'm on duty, I have no sister.

1045
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
What duty? Don't be a fool.

1046
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I have enlisted in the service of an ideal!

1047
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Splendid. I see I can rely on you. I'm going to leave you for a moment.

1048
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But, Arthur, can't you tell me, what's going on?

1049
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I'll tell you everything in due time.

1050
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So that's it… Eugene, you've betrayed us.

1051
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Silence! That's not true, I haven't betrayed anybody.

1052
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Ala! Ala!

1053
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You've betrayed your generation.

1054
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
No, you're the traitors. You've all betrayed our good old days.

1055
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I'm the only one who hasn't.

1056
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
All you are is the tool of a mad pack of young zealots.

1057
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
With a missionary complex. ou think you're so clever.

1058
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
They'll use you and then kick you out like a dog.

1059
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
We'll see who uses whom.

1060
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I've been waiting a long time for someone like Arthur to come along.

1061
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Now at least you've shown who you really are, you hypocrite.

1062
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
You've been wearing a mask.

1063
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Yes, I have. And all these years I've suffered.

1064
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I hated you for your degradation but I kept quiet because I had to,

1065
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
because you were the stronger.

1066
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Now at last I can tell you what I think of you!

1067
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
What a pleasure!

1068
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
What are you going to do to us?

1069
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We're going to give you back your dignity. We're going to turn you degenerates

1070
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
back into human beings with decent principles.

1071
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
By force?

1072
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
If we can't do it any other way, yes.

1073
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
– This is a counter-reformation. – But for you it's salvation.

1074
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
– Salvation? From what? – From your damnable, diabolical freedom.

1075
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
– Uncle Eugene! – Sir?

1076
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Uncle !

1077
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
She's gone.

1078
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Look for her. She must be somewhere.

1079
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yes. She's got to be. I'm still waiting for her answer.

1080
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
What? You mean she hasn’t consented yet?

1081
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
She's got to. She can't leave me in the lurch at a moment like this.

1082
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I don't mean to criticize you, Arthur, but haven't you rushed things a bit?

1083
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I mean, shouldn't you have made sure of her before starting in on these people?

1084
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The time was ripe. I couldn't put it off.

1085
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well, that's how it is with a coup d'etat. Always some unforeseeable factor.

1086
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Still, we can't back out now.

1087
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Who could have dreamed of such a thing? I was so sure I had convinced her.

1088
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Ala, Ala! All because of some dumb cousin. Incredible! Ala, Ala.

1089
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Women have been the ruin of kingdoms and empires

1090
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Gosh, are you all still up?

1091
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
At last! I've been looking all over for you.

1092
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
What's going on? Uncle with a gun? Is it real? Is Uncle real?

1093
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That's none of your business. Where have you been?

1094
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Out for a walk. Anything wrong with that?

1095
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yes! At this solemn hour, there is.

1096
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Steady, Uncle. You're on duty. Well?

1097
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Well, what? It's a lovely night.

1098
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I wasn't asking about the weather. Do you consent?

1099
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I think I need a little more time.

1100
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I need an answer immediately. You've had plenty of time.

1101
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yes.

1102
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Thank God! Now we can start!

1103
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Grandmother, your blessing.

1104
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh, leave me alone. I haven't done anything to you.

1105
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But Grandmother, everything's changed now. I'm going to marry Ala.

1106
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Give us your blessing.

1107
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
On your feet, everybody! Can't you see this is a solemn occasion?

1108
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
My goodness, is Arthur going to get married?

1109
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Is that any reason to make such a fuss?

1110
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Get that boy out of here! He's going to torture me again.

1111
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Grandmother, your blessing.

1112
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
A tasteless joke. It's gone on long enough now.

1113
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
The jokes are over now. You've been having your jokes for fifty years.

1114
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Stomil, button your pajamas immediately! Your son has just plighted his troth.

1115
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
The day of the wide-open fly is past. Bless them, Eugenia.

1116
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
What should I do, Eleanor?

1117
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Give them your blessing if it means so much to them.

1118
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Can't they do without it? It makes me feel so old.

1119
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
A good old-fashioned engagement. Give them your blessing, or I'll shoot.

1120
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I'm going to count to three. Three…

1121
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
This is incredible. If a man can't be comfortable in his own house...

1122
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Two…

1123
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
My blessing upon you, dear children ... and now go to hell!

1124
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Just like old times…

1125
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Stomil has buttoned his fly! A whole new era has begun!

1126
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Eleonor, are you crying?

1127
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Forgive me… But Arthur's getting engaged…

1128
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
and after all he is our son ...

1129
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I know I'm being terribly old-fashioned, but it's so moving. Forgive me.

1130
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Oh, do what you want, all of you!

1131
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
If you'll permit me, on this joyous occasion I would like to wish the young couple

1132
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
all the best for the days to come and especially…

1133
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
You! To the kitchen! And stay there until you're called.

1134
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
To the kitchen.

1135
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
– When's the wedding? – Tomorrow.

1136
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Hurray! We' ve won!

1137
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Photo shoot, everyone!

1138
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
The groom's relatives, please.

1139
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Don't move!

1140
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I can't help it. It's the moth balls.

1141
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Hold it!

1142
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Stomil, your hand.

1143
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But I'm itching all over.

1144
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
– Why should you be itching? – Moths.

1145
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
At this rate we'll never get a picture. Sit down, Eleanor.

1146
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
– The moths come from Mama. – They do not. They come out of this old rag.

1147
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Let's not quarrel. They come from the attic.

1148
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You called, Madame?

1149
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
What? What is it now? Oh yes. My salts, Edward!

1150
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
– What salts, Madame? – Well, my salts… you know.

1151
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Certainly, Madame.

1152
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I must admit it's a relief to see that fellow put in his place.

1153
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
You haven't seen anything yet. You won’t regret it.

1154
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You won't regret a thing.

1155
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
If only this collar weren’t so damn tight!

1156
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That's the price you've got to pay for having Eddie wait on you.

1157
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Everything has its price.

1158
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And my experiments?

1159
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I couldn't say. Arthur hasn't announced his decision on that point yet.

1160
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Maybe he'll let me go on with them. He hasn't said anything?

1161
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
There hasn't been time. He went out early this morning.

1162
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Perhaps you could put in a good word for me?

1163
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I'll speak to him when the opportunity arises.

1164
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
At least once a week. After all these years

1165
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I can't just suddenly stop. You ought to realize that.

1166
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
That will depend entirely on your conductl.

1167
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
But I'm on your side. What more do you want?

1168
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I'm even putting up with this collar.

1169
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Well, I can't promise.

1170
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
What is that?

1171
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
The salts for Madame, sir..

1172
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Eleanor, what is the meaning of this?

1173
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I can't imagine. I asked for my smelling salts.

1174
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Madame no longer drinks?

1175
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Take it away immediately!

1176
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
As you wish, Madame.

1177
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Why? As long as he's brought it . I don't feel too well.

1178
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Don't let it happen again!

1179
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
God, am I bored!

1180
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Back to your places! The groom's relatives…

1181
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Now the best man... which is me.

1182
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Eugene!

1183
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
The brides's relatives.

1184
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Can't I unbutton these buttons for just a second?

1185
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Certainly not! The wedding is at twelve!

1186
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I seem to have put on weight. The last time I wore these things was forty years ago.

1187
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
You have only your experiments to blame for that.

1188
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Experimental art pays so well these days.

1189
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
That's not my fault, is it?

1190
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
When will that picture be ready? I think I blinked. I know I'm going to look awful.

1191
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Don't worry. The camera hasn't worked for years.

1192
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
What? Then why take the picture?

1193
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
It's the principle of the thing. It's a tradition.

1194
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You begrudge me my innocent experiments but is an old-fashioned

1195
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
broken-down camera any better?

1196
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Behold the failure of your counter-reform. All you are doing is destroying

1197
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
what we have won and still without any result.

1198
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Watch your tongue.

1199
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I bow to superior force, but I can still say what I think.

1200
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
What do you say?

1201
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I say we're in one hell of a mess and this is only the beginning.

1202
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It can't be helped. Our first job is to create the form. The content comes later.

1203
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
You're making a colossal mistake, Eugene.

1204
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Formalism will never free you from chaos.

1205
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
You'd be better off if you could just accept the spirit of the times.

1206
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That's enough out of you. Defeatism will not be tolerated!

1207
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
All right, all right. I can still have an opinion, can't I?

1208
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Of course. As long as it agrees with ours.

1209
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Hear that?

1210
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
– Bells… – Wedding bells…

1211
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Ah, here comes our dear little bride.

1212
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Oh, Ala, it's so becoming….

1213
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
My dear child!

1214
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Isn't Arthur back yet?

1215
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
We're expecting him any minute.

1216
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
He had a few final formalities to attend to.

1217
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
These damned formalities.

1218
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
The genius of life cannot go about naked.

1219
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It must be clothed, and its appearance must be cared for.

1220
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Didn't Artur mention this to you? Didn't he talk with you about this subject?

1221
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
For hours on end.

1222
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
And rightly so. Someday you'll understand and be grateful to him.

1223
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh, stop making such an ass of yourself, Uncle.

1224
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
You mustn't talk like that, Ala dear. Today is your wedding day

1225
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
and no time for family quarrels.

1226
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

1227
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Don't worry. No offense.

1228
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So old and so stupid.

1229
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I can understand it in Arthur. But you, Uncle…

1230
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
He had it coming.

1231
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Forgive her, Eugene. She's so excited she doesn't know what she's saying.

1232
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
After all, this is a big day in her life. I remember the day I was married to Stomil…

1233
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I can tell when I'm not wanted. But don't delude yourselves.

1234
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
You can laugh at me as much as you like but childish insults won't change a thing.

1235
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Stomil, come with me. I have a proposition to make to you.

1236
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
All right. Just don't try to brainwash me!

1237
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I also have something to say.

1238
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Mama, you might go for a stroll too.

1239
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It's all the same to me. Either way I'll be bored to death.

1240
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Come, granny.

1241
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
There. Now we can talk. Tell me, what's happened?

1242
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Nothing.

1243
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Something's bothering you. I can see that.

1244
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Nothing is bothering me.

1245
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
This veil doesn't fall quite right.

1246
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You don't have to take that tone with me.

1247
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
With the others it's different. They're such fools.

1248
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Why do you all despise each other?

1249
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I don't know. Maybe because we have no reason to respecteach other.

1250
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yourselves or each other?

1251
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
It comes to the same thing.

1252
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's got to be done all over again.

1253
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Are you happy, Mother?

1254
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I beg your pardon?

1255
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I asked if you were happy. What's so funny about that?

1256
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
– It's a very indiscreet question. – Why? Is it a disgrace to be happy?

1257
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Then you're not very happy? Because you're ashamed.

1258
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
People are always ashamed about not being happy.

1259
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It s like having pimples or not doing your homework.

1260
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It makes them feel guilty, almost criminal.

1261
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
"It is the right and duty of all to be happy, now that

1262
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
The new era has set us free."

1263
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Stomil taught me that.

1264
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Oh. So that's why everybody's so ashamed nowadays.

1265
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But how do you feel about it?

1266
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I've always done as much as I could.

1267
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
To make him happy?

1268
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
No. Myself. That's the way he wanted it.

1269
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Then in a way it was for him?

1270
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Of course it was for him. Oh, if you'd only known him when he was young…

1271
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
– May I set the table now? – Sure, Eddie.

1272
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yes, Edward, you may set the table.

1273
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Yes, madame.

1274
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
– Does Stomil know? – What?

1275
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Don't be like that. I'm not a baby. Your affair with Eddie.

1276
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Of course he knows.

1277
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
And what does he say?

1278
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Nothing, unfortunately. He pretends not to notice.

1279
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's bad.

1280
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
May I set the table now?

1281
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Edward, set the table.

1282
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Oh, Edek is so simple… like life itself. Crude—but that’s precisely his charm.

1283
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
He has no complexes.

1284
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
He’s refreshing. He knows how to want— truly want—and beautifully so.

1285
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
When he sits, he sits like sitting itself: simple, yet perfect.

1286
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
When he eats or drinks, his stomach transforms into a symphony of nature.

1287
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I love watching him digest. He does it so simply and sincerely.

1288
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
In moments like that, I feel the true delight of contact with nature, with the elements.

1289
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Have you ever noticed how wonderfully he adjusts his trousers?

1290
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It’s almost a royal gesture.

1291
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Stomil admires authenticity too.

1292
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I know. It doesn't fascinate me very much.

1293
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You're too young. You haven't had time to learn the value of genuine simplicity.

1294
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You will. It takes experience.

1295
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I'll try. Tell me, do you think it's a good idea for me to marry Arthur?

1296
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, Arthur is something else again. He has principles.

1297
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But Stomil has principles too.

1298
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Oh, those were only opinions. Stomil has always detested principles.

1299
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Arthur, on the other hand, has cast-iron principles.

1300
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And that's all he has.

1301
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Ala, how can you say a thing like that? Arthur's the first man

1302
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
in fifty years to have principles. Doesn't that appeal to you?

1303
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's so original! And it's so becoming to him!

1304
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I'll take Arthur with principles if I have to, Mother.

1305
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
But principles without Arthur--no.

1306
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Isn't he going to marry you?

1307
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Not Arthur.

1308
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Then who?

1309
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
His principles!

1310
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Then why did you accept?

1311
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Because I still have hope.

1312
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Fatal.

1313
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
May I continue?

1314
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Clatter away, Eddie boy. I mean, yes, Edward, do continue, Edward.

1315
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Tell me, Eddie, does it depress you? I’m sorry,

1316
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
but all this overthrow ... thought up by a bunch of fools?

1317
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Why should it depress me?

1318
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Didn't I tell you? He's as free and natural as a butterfly.

1319
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh, Eddie, you set the table so gracefully.

1320
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
– Why should I act like a fool? – Eddie, come here.

1321
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
At your service.

1322
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Tell me, have you got principles?

1323
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Principles? Sure.

1324
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
– What kind? – The best.

1325
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
– Tell me one. Please. – What's in it for me?

1326
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Well, can you or can't you?

1327
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
If I have to, I guess. Just a sec. I wrote them down. Here it is!

1328
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
"I love you, and you're sound sleep."

1329
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
– That's all? – "You made your bed, now lie in it."

1330
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
– Oh, come on, Eddie. Read. – I did read. That's a principle.

1331
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Then read another!

1332
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
What's so funny?

1333
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Well, there's one here…

1334
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Read it!

1335
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I can't, not in mixed company. It's too good.

1336
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,000
And those are your principles?

1337
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Actually, no. I borrowed them from a friend who works for the movies.

1338
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
– You haven't got any of your own? – No.

1339
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Why not?

1340
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
What do I need them for? I know my way around.

1341
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Oh yes, Eddie. You certainly do.

1342
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
No, no! That's asking too much.

1343
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Take my word for it. You'll be glad once it's on.

1344
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Now what's wrong?

1345
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
He wants to strap me into that thing.

1346
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
What is it?

1347
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Great grandfather's corset. Indispensable.

1348
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Pulls in the waist, guarantees a perfect figure for every occasion.

1349
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
No, no, no. I'm wearing spats, I've got this collar on.

1350
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
What are you trying to do--kill me?

1351
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Now, let's not do things by halves.

1352
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I've gone far enough. Let me live!

1353
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
You're falling back into your old habits, Stomil. Stop making such a fuss.

1354
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
You admitted yourself you'd been putting on weight.

1355
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
But I want to be fat! I want to live in harmony with nature!

1356
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So you want an easy life . Don't fight it , accept it.

1357
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Nora, save me!

1358
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You don't think it might improve your looks?

1359
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
My looks? What for? I'm a free fat artist.

1360
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
These perpetual scenes. And you say you still have hope?

1361
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Yes.

1362
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Poor Ala…

1363
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And if you're only deluding yourself?

1364
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
– That's my secret. – You won't tell even me?

1365
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It will be a surprise.

1366
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Uncle Eugene is really overdoing it.

1367
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Do you think he has any influence on Arthur?

1368
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I doubt it. It's probably the other way around.

1369
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Too bad. I thought it was all Uncle's fault.

1370
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'd better go see what they're up to. I have a feeling something

1371
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
is going to happen.

1372
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So do I.

1373
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Careful, Ala.

1374
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Don't go too far— like Uncle Eugene.

1375
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Eddie, my veil!

1376
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
What's going on?

1377
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
You’re late.

1378
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Let him go.

1379
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Why? It would have given him that final polish.

1380
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I said let him go.

1381
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Thank you, Arthur. I'm glad to see you still have human feeling.

1382
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I protest !

1383
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Arthur, what's happened? He's as pale as a ghost !

1384
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
You whited skeleton ...

1385
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Arthur, it's me, it's your Uncle Eugene! Don't you know me?

1386
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
You're choking me. You and I…. together… Don't…

1387
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
You stuffed zero, you synthetic blob , you worm-eaten false bottom!

1388
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Do something! He's choking him!

1389
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You fake !

1390
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
– Do you wish me to change the record? – Who told you to put that on?

1391
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Mr. Eugene. His orders were to put it on as soon as Mr. Arthur entered the room.

1392
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
– Yes ... that's right. .. – We won't need music right now.

1393
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
The whole thing... a fraud!

1394
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
He's dead drunk.

1395
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
That's a slander, an infamous slander. This young man knows his duty.

1396
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I can't believe it either. Arthur never drinks.

1397
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Take it from me. I'm an expert.

1398
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But why today of all days?

1399
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
His last hours as a free man.

1400
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
There must be some misunderstanding. Let's not jump to conclusions.

1401
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
The truth will soon be known.

1402
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes. Wait, he'll explain. He was just getting started.

1403
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
H e's coming to.

1404
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
What is that?

1405
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
He doesn't know his own father. What a misfortune!

1406
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Quiet, you females! It's not my parents I'm asking about.

1407
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
What's the meaning of this masquerade?

1408
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
These... these are spats.

1409
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Oh .. . of course. . t hey're spats.

1410
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Arthur's a little tired. Conditions will return to normal in a moment.

1411
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Take your places. Attention!

1412
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
There will be no change in the program.

1413
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Ha ha, well, Arthur, my boy, you were just joking, weren't you?

1414
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Putting us to the test, you little devil. Don't worry.

1415
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We won't abandon out positions.

1416
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Here we are, all buttoned up from top to toe, once and for all.

1417
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Cheer up, my boy. A little rest, and then ... on with the wedding!

1418
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Can't you see that he's been pillaged like a pig, ghost of the past?

1419
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
My blood, my blood!

1420
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That's a lie! Quiet! Come on, Arthur. It's time for action now.

1421
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Just one last step. ..

1422
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
– Father, forgive me. – What's this? Some new trick?

1423
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I was insane!

1424
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
There's no going back, no present, no past. Nothing!

1425
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
What is he now? A nihilist?

1426
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
What about me? Am I nothing?

1427
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
You too… forgive me!

1428
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You're a coward, that's all you are.

1429
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
No, please don't say that. I'm not afraid, but I can't believe anymore.

1430
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I'll lay down my life but there's no turning back to the old forms.

1431
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
They can't create a reality for us. I was wrong.

1432
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
– What are you talking about? – About creating a world.

1433
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And me? Isn't anybody going to say anything about me?

1434
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
This is treason!

1435
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
You must forgive me too. I raised your hopes and I ve let you down.

1436
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
But believe me, it's impossible…

1437
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I refuse to listen to this kind of talk. Pull yourself together!

1438
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Stand up and get married. Raise a family, brush your teeth,

1439
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
eat with a knife and fork,

1440
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Let the world stand up again, not upside down! You'll see, we'll make it.

1441
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You re not going to throw away our last chance, are you.

1442
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
There never was a chance. We were wrong. It's hopeless.

1443
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Stomil's right. You're drunk. You don't know what you're saying.

1444
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Yes, drunk. When I was sober I let myself be deceived,

1445
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
so I got drunk to dispel my illusions. You'd better have a drink too, Uncle.

1446
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Me? Certainly not… Well, perhaps just a little one.

1447
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I had cold sober reasons for getting drunk. I drank myself sane again.

1448
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Nonsense. You got drunk out of despair.

1449
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Yes, despair too. Despair that form can never save the world.

1450
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
– Then what can? – An ideal !

1451
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
What idea?

1452
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
If I only know ! Conventions always spring from an idea. Father was right.

1453
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I'm a contemptible formalist.

1454
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Don't take it so hard, son. You know I've always been indulgent.

1455
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Frankly, though, I've suffered plenty from your ideas.

1456
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Thank God, that's all over now. Where are my pajamas?

1457
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Stop ! A reversion to pajamas is equally impossible.

1458
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Why? Are you still trying to save us?

1459
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I thought you'd got over that.

1460
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Did you think I was going to cave in completely just like that?

1461
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Just a minute ago you were acting like a human being.

1462
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Don't tell me you want to be an apostle again.

1463
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I gave you the epolons of your lost dignity, and I'm tearing them off!

1464
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Same hand! You want repentance?

1465
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I knelt before you here. My sin was rooted in reason—

1466
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
and abstraction, the lost daughter of reason.

1467
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But now I have conquered my reason with darkness.

1468
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I didn’t simply drink myself into a stupor—

1469
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I did so knowingly, even if my intention was mystical.

1470
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
The fiery ecstasy has purified me.

1471
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And so, you must forgive me, for now I stand before you cleansed.

1472
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I was the one who clothed you in your garments—

1473
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
and I was the one who tore them from you,

1474
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
for they turned out to be shrouds.

1475
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
But I will not leave you naked, exposed to the winds of history,

1476
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
even if you curse me to the very depths of my soul. Eddie!

1477
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
At your service.

1478
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Shut the door !

1479
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Yes, Eddie, shut the door, there's a draft.

1480
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
– Don't let anybody leave. – Okay, boss.

1481
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
This is a violation of civil rights .

1482
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
You want freedom? There is no freedom from life, and life is synthesis.

1483
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
You'd analyze yourselves to death. Luckily, however, you have me.

1484
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Arthur, you know I don't agree with Stomil. But aren't you going a little too far?

1485
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I feel it's my duty to warn you in spite of everything,

1486
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I stand by the freedom of the individual.

1487
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Now what we need is to find an idea.

1488
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Is this; any way to treat your father?

1489
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I wash my hands of the whole business.

1490
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Arthur, lie down for a while. I'll make you a nice cold compress.

1491
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Until we come up with an idea, nobody leaves this room. Eddie. Guard the door!

1492
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Yes, sir.

1493
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Find him an idea, somebody, so he'll leave us alone. If

1494
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I don't go to the kitchen, the cake will be burned to a crisp.

1495
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Maybe it's better not to go against them ... There are two of them.

1496
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
What do you suggest, Uncle?

1497
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Search me… God, maybe?

1498
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
That's been done. Lost His appeal.

1499
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
True. Even in my time there wasn't much you could do with God.

1500
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I grew up in an age of enlightenment and exact science.

1501
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I only mentioned Him for the sake of form.

1502
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Forget about form. What we're after now is a living idea.

1503
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
How about sports? I used to ride horseback.

1504
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Everybody goes in for sports nowadays. A lot of good it does them.

1505
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Sorry. Maybe Stomil has an idea.

1506
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So?

1507
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Experiment. There's an idea.

1508
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Please, this is serious.

1509
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Well, I'm serious too. Blazing trails, opening new frontiers!

1510
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Man is always looking for new worlds to conquer comes from experiment.

1511
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
From trial and error. But always with an aim in view: The new life, radically new!

1512
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
A new life! I don't even know what to do with the old one,

1513
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
but Father is talking about a new life. This is just too much.

1514
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Well, everything is still in the experimental stage, that's why.

1515
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Eleanor, have you got an idea?

1516
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
There's no sense asking a woman.

1517
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I had one once, but I forgot. With a whole household on my head!

1518
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Why don't you ask Eddie? He s got a good head on his shoulders

1519
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,000
When he does say something, you can depend on it.

1520
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
That's right. Eddie is the collective mind.

1521
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Eddie?

1522
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I'd say progress, sir.

1523
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
– Meaning what? – Well, just that, sir: progress.

1524
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
But what kind of progress?

1525
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
The progressive kind, the kind that goes right ahead.

1526
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
You mean forward?

1527
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Right. With the front moving forward.

1528
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Then the front is in back?

1529
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Depends on how you look at it.

1530
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
If you look from back to front, the front is in front,

1531
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
though somehow or other it's also in back.

1532
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
That doesn't sound very clear to me.

1533
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
But it's progressive , sir .

1534
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
There's something I must tell you…

1535
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Not now, Mother. Can't you see the men are discussing politics?

1536
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Just two words…

1537
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
No, I don't like it. I need an idea that naturally, inevitably, leads to form.

1538
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Progress of this kind does nothing but confuse. It's amorphous.

1539
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Please listen to me, my darlings. I won't take much of your time.

1540
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
What is it now?

1541
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I don't know. Something's wrong with Mama.

1542
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Later. We're busy now. I still say we should

1543
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
get back to experiments. Then the idea will come by itself.

1544
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
What are you doing, Mama?

1545
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I'm dying.

1546
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Mother! That's not very funny, you know. Mother says she's dying.

1547
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
What? Dying? Can't she see we're busy?

1548
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Did you hear that, Mama?

1549
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Help me.

1550
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But don't be silly, Mama. There's going to be a wedding today.

1551
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
You wouldn't want to spoil everything by dying, would you?

1552
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Dying? What's all this about death? I never thought about that…

1553
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Death? Excellent idea!

1554
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
This is ridiculous, Eugenia. Pull yourself together. Thisis no way to behave.

1555
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It wouldn't be normal, Grandmother.

1556
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
You're all so intelligent,

1557
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
but if somebody wants to do something as simple as dying,

1558
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
you don't know what to make of it. Really, you are very strange people.

1559
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Look at her. Do something. Maybe she's really…

1560
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Eugenia, this is carrying eccentricity too far. This sort of thing isn't done in our family.

1561
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
This has never happened in our family!

1562
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
No, enough! It's sheer hypocrisy.

1563
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Death… the supreme form.

1564
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
You'll find the key to my room on the table I won't need it anymore. Now I'm leaving.

1565
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
The cards are in the drawer. All marked.

1566
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Death … the supreme form!

1567
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Not exactly viable, though, is it?

1568
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Why not? When it's somebody else's death. Grandma, you're brilliant!

1569
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

1570
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Eugenia, lie properly at least. Or get up this minute .

1571
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Dying is not a way to behave in society

1572
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Stop! Can't you see what's happening?

1573
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I don’t care about good manners, but from the standpoint of the experiment,

1574
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
death is out of the question— it's an irreversible act.

1575
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,000
The fundamental condition of any experiment is repeatability.

1576
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Unless, of course, it’s some sort of trial étude Mama is performing.

1577
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
But even then, we do not approve.

1578
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Come closer, my children.

1579
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Eddie, you tool

1580
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Who are you?

1581
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
We’re ... just us.

1582
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Now she's insulting us. Did I say something funny?

1583
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I'm not feeling so well myself.

1584
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Must be a headache.

1585
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Nothing serious, I guess. Must be these tight clothes.

1586
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Try again, Mama.

1587
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
She's dead.

1588
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Strange. She was always so frivolous.

1589
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I dont want it!

1590
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I don't understand.

1591
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I don't want to have anything to do with this.

1592
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I never dreamed… Stomil, why didn't you warn me?

1593
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Of course, it's all my fault. Frankly I don't see that this changes anything at all.

1594
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
My collar's as tight as ever.

1595
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Eddie, come here !

1596
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You pack a good punch, don't you?

1597
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Not bad, sir.

1598
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
And if necessary, you could…?

1599
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You ask me a question, Mr. Arthur? I'm not sure I heard you right.

1600
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Eddie, I like you. I've always liked you.

1601
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
And I've always thought we'd understand each other someday.

1602
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Then you do understand?

1603
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Eddie understands all right.

1604
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
This business has rather upset me. I'm going to lie down for a while.

1605
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Stay right where you are, Father.

1606
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oh stop ordering me around, you little punk. I'm tired.

1607
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Who do you think you are?

1608
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And you've been having an affair with this flunky?

1609
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
For God's sake, not now. Not with Mama lying there.

1610
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Patience. Now all is clear. Follow me to the happy future.

1611
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I just don't seem to care anymore. I must be getting old.

1612
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
We're just not as young as we used to be, are we, Stomil? What do you think?

1613
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Speak for yourself. You're almost as old as Eugenia was, you old hypocrite.

1614
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I feel fine. By and large. Eleanor, where are you?

1615
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
– Here, Stomil, right beside you. – Come here.

1616
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
– How do you feel? – I feel some kind of ending…

1617
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Uncertainty and indecision are behind us now.

1618
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Now the road lies before us, straight and clear.

1619
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
From now on there will be only one law and one herd.

1620
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
What's he jabbering about now? Oh, my head!

1621
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Something about a new legal code for livestock.

1622
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Do you understand now what the final conclusion is? Ah, of course not —

1623
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
you, beings of flesh, you're only concerned with your glands,

1624
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
you fear for your immortality.

1625
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
But I understand! B ehold your redeemer!

1626
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I have risen above this world, and I will draw you all up after me,

1627
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
because I alone have a brain freed from the snares of the bowels. I...

1628
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
My dear great-nephew,

1629
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
kindly express yourself more clearly.

1630
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Won't you ever understand, you whose lives rot away like mushrooms?

1631
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
You're like blind puppies that would walk in circles forever

1632
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
if they had no master to lead them.

1633
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Without form or ideas, you would crumble to chaos and be consumed

1634
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
by the void if I weren't on hand to save you.

1635
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Do you know what I'm going to do with you? I'm going to create a system

1636
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
in which rebellion will be combined with order, nonbeing with being.

1637
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I will transcend all contradictions.

1638
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It would perhaps be better if you'd just leave the room. You've disappointed me.

1639
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
It's all over between us. I'll probably return to writing my memoirs.

1640
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Let me just ask you this: if nothing exists and if even rebellion is impossible,

1641
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
then what can be raised up out of this nothingness and made to exist?

1642
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It's late. We could all do with a bite to eat

1643
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Isn't anybody going to answer me?

1644
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Eleanor, what are we having for lunch today? I'd like something light.

1645
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
My stomach's a bit queasy.

1646
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
It's high time we took better care of it.

1647
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
You're right, Stomil. From now on we'll look after you.

1648
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You're right, we need to move to a regular life.

1649
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
What? Silence?

1650
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
From now on we will take care of our body.

1651
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
A little nap after lunch, a little stroll after napping.The morning will be for experiments.

1652
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Silence?

1653
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And everything cooked in butter, or maybe cut out fats entirely.

1654
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Of course, a light diet. So it doesn't ruin our sleep.

1655
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
All right, I'll tell you.

1656
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Careful of the dishes, Arthur.

1657
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The only possible answer is power.

1658
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Power? What power? We're your family, remember?

1659
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
He's raving. Don't pay any attention to him.

1660
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Power alone can be created from nothing. Power alone can exist in a vacuum.

1661
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Now I am up here above you, and you are beneath me.

1662
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Brilliant, isn't he?

1663
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Arthur, come down !

1664
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
You grovel beneath me in dust and ashes.

1665
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
How long are we going to put up with this?

1666
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Let him talk. We'll take care of him after lunch.

1667
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It's beyond me where he gets these tendencies. Must be his upbringing.

1668
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Good education!

1669
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Everything depends on being strong and decisive.

1670
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I am strong.

1671
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Look at me then. I am the answer to your dreams.

1672
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Sir, there will be order.

1673
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Father, you have always rebelled, but your rebellion consume

1674
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
itself in chaos. Now look at me !

1675
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Power, too, is rebellion. A revolution in form and order,

1676
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
the revolt of the top against the bottom, the high against the low.

1677
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Neither synthesis nor analysis, I am the act, the will and the way,

1678
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I am power. I am above, within and beside all things.

1679
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Give thanks to me for fulfilling the dreams of your youth.

1680
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Master of the form I choose — and not just one, but a thousand possible forms;

1681
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I can create and destroy as I please, incarnate, disincarnate, amputate!

1682
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I have here within me--everything.

1683
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Sad to see a thing like this happen !

1684
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Oh don't take it so seriously. Adolescent foolishness.

1685
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Words, words, words. What power has he got over us?

1686
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Right! What does all his talk amount to anyway?

1687
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
We're united by blood, not by abstractions.

1688
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
He can't do a thing to us.

1689
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
What power? It's very simple. I can kill you.

1690
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I absolutely forbid you. There are limits.

1691
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Limits can be transcended. You taught me

1692
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
that power over life and death. What greater power can there be?

1693
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
A simple but profoundly important discovery!

1694
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Nonsense! I'll live as long as I please. That is, I mean, as long as it pleases.

1695
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I don't know whom, do you, Stomil?

1696
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
– Well… Nature? – Exactly. Nature or fate.

1697
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
– Me! – Shut up !

1698
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But suppose I become your fate?

1699
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Eleanor, Stomil, what does this mean?

1700
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I won't stand for it. He's your son, after all.

1701
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Look, Arthur. You've frightened your uncle. He's white as a sheet.

1702
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Don't get up, Stomil. I'll get you a pillow.

1703
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Each one of you has a death shut inside you like a nightingale locked in a cage.

1704
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
All I have to do is let it out.

1705
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Nightingale, that was beautiful.

1706
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
We ve talked long enough.

1707
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Our horizons have been expanded, but now it's time for something concrete.

1708
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Enough theory. Let shave something to eat. What do you say, Eleanor?

1709
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I wanted to suggest that some time ago but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

1710
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Enough now, Arthur, come down. Or at least take your shoes off.

1711
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
You're right, Uncle, it's time for something concrete.

1712
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Ed die , my somber angel, angel of divine abstraction, are you ready?

1713
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Ready, chief.

1714
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Then ... Finish me!

1715
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
What are you going to do?

1716
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
First we're going to rub out Uncle Eugene.

1717
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Rub out? Where on earth did you pick that up?

1718
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And now of all times, with my blood pressure skyrocketing!

1719
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Why me?

1720
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
So I'm all just theory, am I? Eddie, show him he's mistaken.

1721
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
You trash! What do you take me for?

1722
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
This isn't a system. It's mob rule.

1723
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Do your duty, Eddie.

1724
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
What does this ape want of me? Keep your hands off me!

1725
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
He's not an ape. He's the right arm of my spirit, my word made flesh.

1726
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Eleanor, I feel awful. Eleanor!

1727
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Look, your father's fainted.

1728
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Madman! Murderer!

1729
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
No! A man who has seen the one possibility and doesn't shrink from it.

1730
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I am pure as nature. I am free. Free!

1731
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Arthur!

1732
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Wait. First we've got to save the world.

1733
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I've been unfaithful to you. With Eddie.

1734
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
What?

1735
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I’ve cheated on you with Eddie. I didn't think you'd mind.

1736
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
After all, you only wanted to marry me out of principle.

1737
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
– When? – This morning.

1738
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I didn't think you'd care. I thought…

1739
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Look I’m ready for the wedding. How do I look?

1740
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Wait a second, wait… You? You did that to me?

1741
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I forgot to tell you You were busy ... We can go now?

1742
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Should I wear my gloves? They’re a bit tight. You like the way I've done my hair?

1743
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
You did that to me?

1744
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Ah, that's what this is all about. I wouldn't have thought you'd be so concerned.

1745
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Let’s change the subject, shall we?

1746
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
How could you… how could you ...

1747
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But you said you only needed me to help you with your plan. Don't you remember?

1748
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I didn't misunderstand you, did I?

1749
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
When we were talking and you said such clever things, I was impressed.

1750
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Eddie could never have spoken like that.

1751
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Eddie!

1752
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
What's got into you, darling? I've told you, I didn't think you'd care.

1753
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Frankly, I'm surprised at you making such a fuss over nothing.

1754
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Now I'm sorry I even told you.

1755
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
But why?

1756
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Oh, my stubborn darling! I had my reasons.

1757
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
What reasons?

1758
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Let's forget about it. You're just getting yourself all worked up.

1759
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Tell me!

1760
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I only wanted to…

1761
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Your reasons…

1762
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Oh, the stupidest, silliest little reasons ...

1763
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Go on!

1764
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I won't tell you. You always get mad.

1765
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Oh God!

1766
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
If you want, we'll never say another word about the whole thing. Is it all my fault?

1767
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Why are you all against me? What have I done to you?

1768
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Mother, did you hear that?

1769
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Ala, I warned you.

1770
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Mama, tell her she mustn't do such things.

1771
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Do something, help me, I can't live like this. Tell her…

1772
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
How can she treat me like this silly child.

1773
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Get away from me, you fool.

1774
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I wanted to save you. I was so close… And now you've ruined it all.

1775
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Ah, the world is evil, evil, evil.

1776
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Come to me, Arthur! Oh, my poor boy, I feel so sorry for you.

1777
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Sorry for me? You dare to pity me? I don't need anyone's pity.

1778
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
You don't know me yet… but you're going to now.

1779
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You've rejected my idea. You've trampled me under-foot.

1780
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
And you besmirched the noblest idea in all history, you goose!

1781
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
You can't even begin to imagine who it is vou've lost. And who did you do it with?

1782
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
With this half-witted punk, this garbage dumped out by our times !

1783
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I'll go away, but I won t leave you behind in this world.

1784
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
You don't know what you re living for anyway.

1785
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Where is he, your darling lover?

1786
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Where's that rotten beer belly anyway? I'll fix that early bird's guts! Where ’s the revolver?

1787
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
It's impossible to find anything with all this damned order!

1788
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Mama, have you seen the revolver?

1789
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
That was hard.

1790
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Arthur!

1791
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Arthur, my boy…

1792
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Strange… everything's disappeared…

1793
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
But I didn't want… It's not true!

1794
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I loved you, Ala. ..

1795
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Why didn't you tell me before?

1796
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
"I love you and you're sound asleep."

1797
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Wake up , Stomil . Your son is dying!

1798
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
He’s dead.

1799
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Perhaps he's better off. He nearly murdered his uncle.

1800
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Forgive him. He wasn't happy.

1801
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Oh, I don't bear him any grudge. He can't hurt me now.

1802
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
He wanted to overcome carelessness and neglect.

1803
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
He lived rationally, but too passionately.

1804
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
He died because his thought had betrayed his feelings.

1805
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
He meant well, but he was too highstrung. His kind never gets old.

1806
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Hold your tongue, you scoundrel, and get out of my house.

1807
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You ought to be glad to get off so easy.

1808
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Why should I leave? I'll say it again: Arthur meant well. I'm staying.

1809
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Why?

1810
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
It's my turn now. Now you're all going to listen to me.

1811
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
We listen? To you?

1812
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Sure why not? You've seen that I pack a wicked punch.

1813
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Nothing to worry about so long as you keep quiet

1814
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
and do what I say. You'll see. You won't have to worry.

1815
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I'm an open, easygoing man. I like a joke, like a good time.

1816
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
But listen to me.

1817
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
We're in for it now.

1818
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
You know, Eugene, you talk too much.

1819
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Take my shoes off for me will you?

1820
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I submit to brute force. But I'll despise him in my heart.

1821
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Go ahead and despise me, but now take my shoes off, and quick.

1822
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I've always thought we were slaves of abstractions, but that someday

1823
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,000
humanity would take its revenge. Now I see that it's only Eddie.

1824
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Maybe it won't be so bad. He certainly won't mind if you diet.

1825
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Should I shine them?

1826
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It’s yours. I'm changing anyway.

1827
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
A little tight , but not bad .

1828
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Come, Eleanor. We're only a poor old couple now.

1829
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Don't go too far, and be ready to come running when I call.

1830
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Are you coming with us, Ala?

1831
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I'm coming. He loved me, nobody can take that away from me.

1832
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
We may as well assume it was love.

1833
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Did you say something, Father?

1834
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Me? No.

1835
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I've got the feeling, Arthur, my boy, that nobody needs you anymore.

1836
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Well, Uncle Eugene, would you like to dance?

1837
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Me? With you? Oh, all right, why not?
