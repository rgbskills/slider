1
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:13,042
Three of spades. Razor blades.

2
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:17,303
Indeed, yes!

3
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:25,825
Here.

4
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:30,086
Eugene…

5
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:34,347
Well… plunk…

6
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:38,608
Plunk what, Eugene?

7
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:42,869
The old gentleman's not in form today.

8
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:47,130
Eugene! If you're going to play with us, you've got to do it right.

9
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,391
Plunk's all right, but then what?

10
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:55,652
Well, just plain plunk!

11
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:59,914
God, he’s blushing again.

12
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:04,175
Maybe… ”plunk-plunk”.

13
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:08,436
Certainly not. Why don't you help him out, Eddie?

14
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:12,697
With plunk? That's a tough word to work with.

15
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:16,958
How about: Scram, Sam. We're on the lam.

16
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:21,219
Splendid. But if you'll excuse my asking, what does it mean? Who's on the lam?

17
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,480
It's what they say, that's all.

18
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,741
Don’t make a fuss. Mr. Eddie is an expert.

19
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,002
It's what they say, that's all.

20
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:38,263
See, with a little effort you can do it too.

21
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:42,524
The old gentleman is a bit bashful…

22
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:46,785
Thank you, Eddie dear. I don't know what we would do without you

23
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:51,046
It’s nothing… I'd better be leaving.

24
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:55,308
What? Why? What's got into you? Right in the middle of our game?

25
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:59,569
Good afternoon !

26
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,830
Oh, it's you.

27
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,091
M e. What's going on here anyway?

28
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:12,352
What do you mean? We're just having our little game.

29
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,613
I can see that. But with whom?

30
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:20,874
With whom? Don't you recognize your Uncle Eugene any more?

31
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:25,135
I wasn't asking about Uncle Eugene. I'll settle with him later.

32
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:29,396
Who is this individual?

33
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:33,657
I'll just be running along now: Madam, the pleasure was mine.

34
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:37,918
Edward! Stay!

35
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,179
Out! Out!

36
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:46,441
Dear lady, didn't I tell you we shouldn't have played today?

37
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:50,702
It's her fault. Entirely her fault. I didn't even want to play.

38
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:54,963
I said : o ut!

39
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:59,224
Easy, Aces. I'm going!

40
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:03,485
How often have I told you never to let this happen again? Mom!

41
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:07,746
No! No!

42
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:12,007
Oh yes, oh yes! And right now too!

43
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:16,268
What do you want of me anyway?

44
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:20,529
You know very well what I want.

45
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:24,790
Arthur, have you no pity for your own grandmother?

46
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,051
Oh, so you're talking back again are you, Uncle?

47
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:33,312
Interesting, interesting !

48
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:37,573
Not at all. I simply wanted to say that even if Eugenia may have forgotten herself a bit. ..

49
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:41,835
Then I'll just have to remind her. And you too, Uncle. Pity!

50
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:46,096
How can you talk about pity? Do any of you have any pity for me?

51
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:50,357
Does she ever try to understand me? Uncle, you're going to get what's coming to you.

52
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:54,618
Why aren't you working? Why aren't you writing your memoirs?

53
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:58,879
I did write a bit this morning, but then they came barging into my room, and…

54
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,140
Eugene! Traitor!

55
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,401
Why can't you all just leave me in peace?

56
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:11,662
But you've got to be punished too. Now sit there until I let you out.

57
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,923
Serves him right.

58
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:20,184
Don't think you're going to get off free. Hup! Up you go!

59
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:24,445
Again? I don't want to!

60
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:28,706
Not another word!

61
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:32,967
Terrific!

62
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:37,229
Thank you, Judas!

63
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,490
Your cards were no good anyway.

64
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,751
Fool!

65
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:50,012
Shut up! This ought to cure you of your disgusting frivolity.

66
00:06:50,012 --> 00:06:54,273
Matches! Who's got a match?

67
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:58,534
At least spare me the candles, Arthur.

68
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:02,795
Quiet, or I'll think up something really grim.

69
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:07,056
Here!

70
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:15,578
Great pictures!

71
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:19,839
What's he looking at?

72
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,100
Handbook of anatomy. University edition.

73
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,362
Is Mr. Arthur studying medicine?

74
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:32,623
He's studying for three different degrees. One in philosophy.

75
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:36,884
They don't illustrate philosophy.

76
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:41,145
They don’t.

77
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:45,406
Too bad. It might be good.

78
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:49,667
Let me see!

79
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:53,928
Lie down!

80
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:58,189
To think that you're the youngest one of us all! Why don't you enter a monastery?

81
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:02,450
Why do you simply refuse to understand me, Grandmother?

82
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,711
Why do you refuse to understand him, Eugenia?

83
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:10,972
I just can't live in a world like this!

84
00:08:10,972 --> 00:08:15,233
What kind of world? What are you people doing?

85
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:19,494
Good morning, Mother.

86
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:23,756
Mama! On the catafalque again?

87
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:28,017
A good thing you've come Now you can see for yourself how he treats me.

88
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:32,278
How I treat you? She had to be disciplined.

89
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,539
He's trying to educate me.

90
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,800
She really goes too far.

91
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,061
– What did she do? – She knows.

92
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:49,322
But why the catafalque?

93
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:53,583
To remind her of eternity. Let her lie there and look within.

94
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,844
Ah, Eddie !

95
00:08:57,844 --> 00:09:02,105
Hi!

96
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:06,366
You mean you know each other?

97
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:10,627
Here we go.

98
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:14,888
Everybody knows Eddie. Why not?

99
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,150
I m going mad. I come home and what do I find? Laxity, chaos, shady characters,

100
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,411
ambiquous relationships. And on top of all that, it turns out that even you.

101
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:27,672
No! No! Why does all this have to happen? Where is it all going to end?

102
00:09:27,672 --> 00:09:31,933
Perhaps you'd like something to eat?

103
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:36,194
Eat? No. All I want is to get the situation under control.

104
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:40,455
I sleep with Eddie from time to time. Don't I, Eddie?

105
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,716
What? Oh yes. Of course.

106
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:48,977
Somewhat of an understatement.

107
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:57,499
What's that? What did you say, Mother?

108
00:09:57,499 --> 00:10:01,760
I'm off… I'll get you something to eat right away.

109
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:10,283
Look at that! And all in color!

110
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:14,544
Arthur… May I take this off now?

111
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:23,066
What's wrong, Arthur?

112
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:27,327
Christ, this thing is hard!

113
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,588
I understand that this business about your mother.

114
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:35,849
I can well understand that. I'm an old-timer. ..

115
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:40,110
Eddie's not a bad sort. He has a good heart even if he doesn't look very bright.

116
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,371
Between you and me, he's not quite all there. ..

117
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:48,632
But what can you expect, my dear boy?

118
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:52,893
Life must be taken as it is… or must it? Now, now, Arthur. Chin up!

119
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:57,154
Eddie has his good points, and after all, my goodness we've got to face up to it:

120
00:10:57,154 --> 00:11:01,415
your mother isn't quite what she used to be.

121
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:05,677
You should have seen her when she was young, before you were born, of course.

122
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:09,938
What are you planning to do about Eddie anyway?

123
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:14,199
Frankly, he's a thoroughly bad sort. His fingernails are always so dirty.

124
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:18,460
And I'm convinced that he cheats at cards.

125
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,721
He smacks his lips when he eats and he goes around here as if he owned the place.

126
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:26,982
I wouldn'teven shake hands with him if I weren't afraid of offending Eugenia.

127
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:31,243
I wouldn't want to influence you, but if I were you, I'd get rid of him.

128
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:35,504
How about throwing him down the stairs?

129
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:39,765
– Oh, that wouldn't really solve anything. – Or maybe a left hook right in the face?

130
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,026
That’s not the core of the problem.

131
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:48,287
Just a small one right in the face? It couldn't do any harm.

132
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:52,548
If it's all right with you, I'll tell him to get ready for one.

133
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:56,810
– May I take down the cage, Arthur? – Take it off, uncle, it doesn't matter.

134
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,071
Eddie is simple, yes, simple and very decent.

135
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:05,332
I have never in all my years met a simpler man.

136
00:12:05,332 --> 00:12:09,593
– What's wrong with him? – I don't know. He just doesn't react anymore.

137
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:13,854
What are you whispering in his ear?

138
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:18,115
Me? Nothing. I've just been telling him about the life of the bees.

139
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:22,376
Breakfast is ready.

140
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:26,637
Mother.

141
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:30,898
– Could you let me have this until Tuesday? – I'm afraid not. I've got an exam on Monday.

142
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:35,159
Too bad. Some terrific pictures in here.

143
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,681
Thanks, mother.

144
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:52,204
Mother, get down off that thing, will you? You look like a character out of Edgar Allen Poe.

145
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,465
Out of what?

146
00:12:56,465 --> 00:13:00,726
Oh, just lik e ... It's all so terribly old-fashioned.

147
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:04,987
But what will he say?

148
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:09,248
He's drinking coffee now. He won't say anything.

149
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:13,509
Arthur, may I get down?

150
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:17,770
It's all the same to me. This coffee's bitter.

151
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,031
We're all out of sugar. Eugene ate it.

152
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:26,292
I beg your pardon. All I ate was the jam. It was Eddie who ate up the sugar.

153
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:30,553
And blow those candles out, will you? We've got to economize.

154
00:13:30,553 --> 00:13:34,814
Who's winning?

155
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:39,075
Eddie.

156
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:43,336
There is something positively unnatural about Edward's good luck.

157
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:47,598
– Eddie, have you been cheating? – Me? Never.

158
00:13:47,598 --> 00:13:51,859
But you promised you'd lose today. I need the money for groceries.

159
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:56,120
Tough luck!

160
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,381
I smelled coffee. Hello, Eddie.

161
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:04,642
Good morning, sir.

162
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:08,903
I thought this was your day to sleep until noon. The bed will be occupied after lunch.

163
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:13,164
I can't sleep. A new idea came to me. Who's drinking coffee anyway? Oh, it's you, Arthur ?

164
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:21,686
– Can't you at least button your pajamas? – What for?

165
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:25,947
What for? What do you mean, what for?

166
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:30,208
I mean: What for? Such a simple question and you can't find an answer.

167
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:34,469
Because ... one just doesn't appear like that.

168
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:38,731
You see? Your answer is meaningless. It's pure convention.

169
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:42,992
It won't stand up under the scrutiny of the intellect.

170
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:47,253
Isn't that enough?

171
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:51,514
Not at all. Not for me. I'm the kind of man who goes deeper.

172
00:14:51,514 --> 00:14:55,775
If we're going to discuss this, we've got to take the imponderables into account.

173
00:14:55,775 --> 00:15:00,036
Oh Lord, Father, can't you button your fly first and then talk it over?

174
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:04,297
That would be a complete reversal of the logical thought process.

175
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:08,558
The effect would precede the cause.

176
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:12,819
Man should never act without thinking, never act like an automaton.

177
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:17,080
I take it then that you will not button your pajamas.

178
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,341
No, son. Anyway, I can't. No buttons.

179
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:25,602
I might have expected as much.

180
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:29,863
Not at all. In this case at least, matter springs from the mind.

181
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:34,125
That's precisely what I wanted to talk to you about, Father.

182
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:38,386
Later, boy. Later. Isn't anybody ever going to remove that thing?

183
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:42,647
Why?

184
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:46,908
Well, I have nothing against it on purely formal grounds

185
00:15:46,908 --> 00:15:51,169
Actually it enriches reality, stimulates the imagination.

186
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:55,430
But I could use the space for my experiments.

187
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,691
But you've got the whole house.

188
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:03,952
I'd be glad, too, if you got rid of it Then Arthur couldn't torture me.

189
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:08,213
You see? What's going on in this house? Chaos, anarchy, entropy.

190
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:12,474
How long has it been since Grandfather died?

191
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:16,735
Ten years!

192
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:20,996
And all that time nobody's ever thought of riddling the house of that catafalque.

193
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:25,257
Incredible! We should be grateful that you at least took Grandfather out of the house.

194
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:29,519
We couldn't keep him any longer.

195
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,780
I'm not interested in the details. It's the principle of the thing.

196
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,041
Really?

197
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:42,302
But it's not only Grandfather !

198
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:46,563
I was born twenty-five years ago and my baby carriage is still standing here.

199
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:50,824
Why isn't it up in the attic? And what's this thing?

200
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:55,085
Mother's wedding dress !

201
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:59,346
Why isn't it put away in a closet? And Uncle Eugene's riding breeches

202
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:03,607
What are they lying around here for when the last horse he ever rode

203
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,868
died forty years ago?

204
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:12,129
My dear.

205
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:16,390
No order, no sense of reality, no decency, no initiative.

206
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,652
You can't move in this place, you can't breathe, you can't live!

207
00:17:20,652 --> 00:17:24,913
How beautifully you drink, Eddie!

208
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:29,174
My boy, tradition doesn't interest me in the slightest.Your indignation is absurd.

209
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,435
You know very well we attach no importance to these monuments of the past,

210
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:37,696
these relics of family tradition.

211
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:41,957
That's why everything's lying around like this. We live in freedom.

212
00:17:41,957 --> 00:17:46,218
Where's my coffee?

213
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:50,479
No, no, Father, you just don't understand me. That's not what bothers me. No, that's not it.

214
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:54,740
Then kindly explain yourself more clearly, will you, boy? Isn't there any more coffee?

215
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,001
No, there won't be any until the day after tomorrow.

216
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:03,262
Why the day after tomorrow?

217
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:07,523
How should I know?

218
00:18:07,523 --> 00:18:11,784
All right, Never mind.

219
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:16,046
Listen to me! It's not this particular tradition that bothers me.

220
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:20,307
It's a fact that in this family there’s no frame of reference at all.

221
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:24,568
All that's left is bits and pieces, fragments, rubbish.

222
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:28,829
You've destroyed everything but you go on destroying;

223
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:33,090
you've gone on so long you've finally forgotten why you began in the first place.

224
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,351
He's right. Stomil, do you still remember how we shattered tradition?

225
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,612
How, in protest against tradition, I gave myself to you with Mummy

226
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:45,873
and Daddy looking on? In the first row of the orchestra

227
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:50,134
at the opening night of Tannhauser.

228
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:54,395
What a gorgeous scandal that was!

229
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:58,656
Where are the days when people were still shocked by such things?

230
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:02,917
And then you proposed to me.

231
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:07,179
As I recall it was at the National Museum's first avantgarde exhibition.

232
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:11,440
The critics gave us rave reviews.

233
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,701
No. It was at the opera. At the exhibition it wasn't you, or maybe it wasn't me.

234
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:19,962
You're getting everything mixed up.

235
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:24,223
The days of revolt, the time of the great leap forward.

236
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:28,484
Liberation from the fetters of the old art and the old way of life.

237
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:32,745
Man coming into his own, man overthrowing the old gods and putting himself on the pedestal.

238
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:37,006
The seed burst open, the chains snapped.

239
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:41,267
Revolution and release. That was our slogan then.

240
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:45,528
Away with outmoded forms, down with convention! Long live the dynamic!

241
00:19:45,528 --> 00:19:49,789
Life as creation, an incessant striving toward new frontiers

242
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,050
Movement and struggle! All form transcended!

243
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:58,311
Stomil! You've been drinking at the fountain of youth! I hardly recognize you.

244
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:02,573
Yes, we were young once.

245
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:06,834
What do you mean? We haven't grown any older. We've never betrayed our ideals.

246
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:11,095
Why, even now our motto is still: Forward! Ever forward!

247
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:15,356
Yes. Yes. Forward!

248
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:19,617
Do we have any prejudices? Do conventions mean anything to us?

249
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:23,878
Aren't we still fighting against the old? Aren't we free?

250
00:20:23,878 --> 00:20:28,139
The old what?

251
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:32,400
Well, the old times. Don't you remember?

252
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,661
Don't tell me you've forgotten what we were just talking about?

253
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:40,922
All those fetters, those rusty chains of religion, morality, society, art.

254
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:45,183
Especially art, Stomil. Art!

255
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,444
Yes, of course. But when was all that actually?

256
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:57,967
Just a minute. Let me figure it out. We were married in 1900…

257
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:02,228
no, just let me thin ... Arthur was born i n...

258
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:10,750
We're young. Eternally young .. .

259
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,011
– Father's right. – What do you mean?

260
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:19,272
It's all dead and gone now. All in the past.

261
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:23,533
What's gone?

262
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:27,794
The shackles, the religion, the morals, the handcuffs, the carcasses and so on!

263
00:21:27,794 --> 00:21:32,055
They're all gone now, unfortunately.

264
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:36,316
Unfortunately? You don't know what you're saying. If you'd lived in those days,

265
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:40,577
you'd know how much we've done for you.

266
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:44,838
You have no idea what the world was like then.

267
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:49,100
Can you imagine how much courage it took to dance the tango?

268
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,361
Do you realize that in those days there were hardly any fallen women?

269
00:21:53,361 --> 00:21:57,622
That the only recognized style of painting was naturalism?

270
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:01,883
That the theater was utterly bourgeois? Stifling.

271
00:22:01,883 --> 00:22:06,144
You couldn't even put your elbows down on the dinner table!

272
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:10,405
I can still remember a youth demonstration. It wasn't until after nineteen …

273
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:14,666
…I don’t know when… the most advanced spirits

274
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:18,927
stopped giving up their seats to elderly people.

275
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:23,188
No, we didn't spare ourselves in our struggle for these rights and if you

276
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:27,449
today can push your grandmother around, its to us your thanks are due.

277
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:31,710
You simply can't imagine how much you owe us.

278
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,971
To think how we struggled to give you

279
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:40,232
this freedom which you now despise!

280
00:22:40,232 --> 00:22:44,494
What did you produce? This bawdyhouse where  nothing works because

281
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:48,755
everyone can do what he pleases, where there are no laws and no violations?

282
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:53,016
I know only one law: Don't hesitate, do what you feel like.

283
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:57,277
Every man is entitled to his own kind of happiness.

284
00:22:57,277 --> 00:23:01,538
Stomil, I've got it! I've figured it out! It was 1968.

285
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:05,799
What was?

286
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,060
I've forgotten.

287
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,321
You've poisoned the generations before you and after you with your freedom.

288
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:18,582
Look at Grandmother! She's completely addled. Haven't you noticed?

289
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:22,843
I just knew he'd drag me into it.

290
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:27,104
There's nothing wrong with Mama. What do you mean?

291
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:31,365
Naturally you're not shocked by her senile demoralization.

292
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:35,626
Once she was a dignified, self-respecting grandmother. And now?

293
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:39,888
Now she plays poker with Eddie!

294
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:44,149
I beg your pardon. We also play bridge, you know.

295
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,410
I wasn't talking to you.

296
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,671
Each has the right to do what he wants and with whomever he chooses.

297
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:56,932
Old people too.

298
00:23:56,932 --> 00:24:01,193
That's not a right. It's a moral obligation to be immoral.

299
00:24:01,193 --> 00:24:05,454
You astonish me. Your opinions are so terribly outdated.

300
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:09,715
When we were your age, we considered every kind of conformity disgraceful.

301
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:13,976
Rebellion! Rebellion alone had any value for us.

302
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:18,237
What value?

303
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:22,498
A dynamic and therefore positive value,

304
00:24:22,498 --> 00:24:26,759
though sometimes in a negative way.

305
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,021
I trust you don't think we were merely blind anarchists? Right, Eleonora?

306
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:35,282
Not?

307
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:39,543
We were a column marching off to the future, a movement, a historical process.

308
00:24:39,543 --> 00:24:43,804
Rebellion is the rock on which progress builds its temple.

309
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:48,065
Believe me: the scope of our rebellion was prodigious.

310
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:52,326
The greater the scope of the rebellion the grander the temple will be.

311
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:56,587
The larger the area covered by the rebellion,

312
00:24:56,587 --> 00:25:00,848
the more spacious the building will be.

313
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:05,109
And believe me, we've prepared the ground for a good chunk of it.

314
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:09,370
If you too are trying to do something constructive, why can't we build together?

315
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,631
Impossible. Let’s start this over.

316
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:17,892
What I said just now was purely objective. I described our historical role,

317
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:22,153
but said nothing of our intentions.

318
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:26,415
We have always pursued our own inclinations. Haven’t we, Eleonora?

319
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:30,676
Yes.

320
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:34,937
But by opposing everything, we paved the way for the future.

321
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:39,198
What future?

322
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:43,459
That's not my affair. My job was to shatter existing forms.

323
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,720
In other words, we're still enemies?

324
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,981
– Eddie, Eddie! – Coming, granny.

325
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:56,242
Why take it so tragically? All you need to do is stop worrying about principles.

326
00:25:56,242 --> 00:26:00,503
I wonder why you, the youngest of us all, should be the one to harp on principles.

327
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:04,764
It used to be the other way around.

328
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:09,025
Because I'm starting out in the world. But what a world!

329
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:13,286
If I want a world, I've got to make one.

330
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:17,547
Don't you want to be modern? At your age?

331
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:21,809
That's just the point. Be modern. Even Grandmother has grown old

332
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:26,070
in this world that has lost its standards.

333
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,331
That’s how modern your era is. What's more, you've grown old in it.

334
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:34,592
I should like to call your attention to certain achievements,

335
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,853
for instance, the right to wear short pants… the fresh feel of the breeze ...

336
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:43,114
Oh, keep quiet, Uncle. Don't you realize that,

337
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:47,375
because everything is possible.

338
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:51,636
The whole thing is absurd.

339
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:55,897
– What do you want then? Tradition? – An orderly world!

340
00:26:55,897 --> 00:27:00,158
That's all?

341
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:04,419
…and the right to rebel.

342
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:08,680
That's it. That's what I've been telling you all along:

343
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,942
Don't you see that you've deprived me of every last chance to revolt?

344
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:17,203
You've been nonconformists so long that there aren't any conventions left

345
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:21,464
to rebel against. You've left nothing for me nothing!

346
00:27:21,464 --> 00:27:25,725
Your only norm is the absence of all norms.

347
00:27:25,725 --> 00:27:29,986
The only thing left for me to rebel against is you.

348
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:34,247
Go right ahead. Did I ever tell you not to?

349
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:38,508
That's the stuff, Arthur. You'll show them.

350
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:42,769
Maybe it would calm you down. You’re so tense nowadays.

351
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:47,030
– Impossible! – Why?

352
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,291
Rebel against you? What are you anyway?

353
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:55,552
A formless mass, an amorphous blob, an atomized world, a mob without shape

354
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:59,813
or structure. Your world can't even be blown up; it’s disintegraged all by itself.

355
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:04,074
– You mean we're no good for anything? – Exactly.

356
00:28:04,074 --> 00:28:08,336
But couldn't you just try?

357
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:12,597
There's nothing to try. It's hopeless. You're all so disgustingly tolerant.

358
00:28:12,597 --> 00:28:16,858
Yes, that could be irritating, I suppose.

359
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,380
Still, I don't like to see you feeling so left out.

360
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,641
You mustn't think your mother's heart is made of stone.

361
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,902
We all love you, Arthur. We want to help you.

362
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:38,163
It's hopeless.

363
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:42,424
This nonconformism you're pushing me into is only a new kind of conformism.

364
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:46,685
But I can't be a conformist forever.

365
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,946
I’ve got an age. My friends are all laughing at me.

366
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:55,207
But what about art, Arthur? Art?

367
00:28:55,207 --> 00:28:59,469
Exactly. You've taken the words out of my mouth.

368
00:28:59,469 --> 00:29:03,730
What art?

369
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,991
Well, art in general. I've devoted my whole life to art.

370
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:12,252
Art is eternal rebellion. Why don't you give it a try?

371
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:16,513
Father, you bore me. I want to be a doctor !

372
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:20,774
A disgrace to the whole family! I've always dreamed of his becoming an artist.

373
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:25,035
When I was carrying him in my womb, I ran through the woods naked, singing Bach.

374
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:33,557
All for nothing!

375
00:29:33,557 --> 00:29:37,818
Maybe you sang out of tune , Mother .

376
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:42,079
All the same, don't give up hope. You still don't understand the value of art.

377
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,340
I've just had an idea for a new experiment.

378
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,601
Eugenia, Eddie. Stomil has come up with something new.

379
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:54,863
Again?

380
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:59,124
Yes. It came to me this morning. It's absolutely original.

381
00:29:59,124 --> 00:30:03,385
You'll put it on right away, won't you, Stomil?

382
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,646
I'm ready.

383
00:30:07,646 --> 00:30:11,907
Heaven help us!

384
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:16,168
Eugene, move the table. Make room.

385
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:20,429
Where am I? First all that shouting and now they're moving furniture...

386
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:24,690
What time is it anyway?

387
00:30:28,951 --> 00:30:33,212
I forgot to tell you, Ala has been here since six o'clock this morning.

388
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:41,734
Ala, you're just in time for the show.

389
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:45,995
But why didn't you tell me? If I'd known, I'd have kept them quiet.

390
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:50,257
Eddie , f ace to the wall !

391
00:30:50,257 --> 00:30:54,518
Did you sleep well?

392
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:58,779
So so.

393
00:30:58,779 --> 00:31:03,040
How long can you stay?

394
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,301
I don't know. I told Mother I might never go back.

395
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:11,562
– And what did she say? – Nothing. She wasn't there.

396
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:15,823
Then how could you tell her?

397
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:20,084
Maybe I didn't. I don't remember.

398
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:24,345
– You've forgotten? – It was so long ago.

399
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:28,606
How about some breakfast? Oh! We're out of coffee.

400
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:32,867
MayI sit beside you?

401
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:37,128
Why not?

402
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:45,651
You're very lovely. What are you laughing about?

403
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:49,912
– Me? Laughing? I'm not laughing. – But you were.

404
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:54,173
Are you trying to pick a fight?

405
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:58,434
– I've been thinking about you a lot, Ala. – Go on.

406
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:02,695
– I thought about meeting you! – Go on.

407
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:06,956
– And sitting down beside yo ... – Go on.

408
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:11,217
–. .. and talking with you . -Go on.

409
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:15,478
– ... about one thing and another ... – Go on.

410
00:32:15,478 --> 00:32:19,739
– About different kinds of things. – Go on! Go on!

411
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:24,000
– Would you marry me? – Go on.

412
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,261
What's wrong with you?

413
00:32:28,261 --> 00:32:32,522
What do you want anyway?

414
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:36,784
That's what they all keep asking me.

415
00:32:36,784 --> 00:32:41,045
Never mind. I don't need to know.

416
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:45,306
Kindly take your seats. T ake your seats.

417
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:49,567
Eddie, where are you going?

418
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:53,828
Be back in a minute .. .

419
00:32:53,828 --> 00:32:58,089
You stay right here!

420
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,350
Arthur, Ala, what are you doing? We're waiting for you.

421
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,611
Experimental theatre . My father’s obsession.

422
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:15,133
Ladies and gentlemen ... the heroes of the play: Adam and Eve in paradise !

423
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:19,394
– We've had that. – When?

424
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:23,655
At the beginning of the world.

425
00:33:23,655 --> 00:33:27,916
That was the old version. This is a new one.

426
00:33:32,178 --> 00:33:36,439
Where's the snake?

427
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:40,700
Shhh!

428
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,961
The snake is in our imagination. We all know the story.

429
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:49,222
Attention! Here we go!

430
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:57,744
So I'm Adam and I’m in Paradise.

431
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:02,005
And before me lies a world of possibilities.

432
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:06,266
But now it starts. From Adam's bone Eve steps upon the earth.

433
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:10,527
To what will shegive birth? Destiny, 'tis known to you alone.

434
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:14,788
Adam was first, but he did not exist until I also came to be.

435
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:19,049
He walks so proudly still. Doesn't the poor man see for all his intellection ...

436
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:23,311
That there is no perfection Except in what is not?

437
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,572
Where does the darkness go When the sun comes out?

438
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:36,094
Well, what do you say? Not bad, eh?

439
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:40,355
Stomil, you frightened us so!

440
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:44,616
Every experiment must shock. T hat's my first principle.

441
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:48,877
If that's what you were after, it was a success all right. My heart's still pounding.

442
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:53,138
How did you do it, Stomil?

443
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:57,399
I blew the fuse and fired the revolver.

444
00:34:57,399 --> 00:35:01,660
– Marvelous! – What’s marvelous in that?

445
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,921
– Don't you understand? – No, I don' t.

446
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:10,182
Don't mind him, Stomil. Eugene has always been slow.

447
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:14,443
– How about you, Eugenia – Huh?

448
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:18,705
Did you understand the experiment, Grandmother ?

449
00:35:18,705 --> 00:35:22,966
– What? – It has made her deaf.

450
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:27,227
That doesn't surprise me.

451
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:31,488
Let me explain. The shock method creates

452
00:35:31,488 --> 00:35:35,749
an immediate unity of action and perception. See?

453
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:44,271
– Yes, but… – Yes, but what?

454
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:48,532
But what's that got to do with Adam and Eve?

455
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:52,793
Eugene, do try to concentrate !

456
00:35:52,793 --> 00:35:57,054
What we are dealing with here is a theatrical phenomenon, the dynamics of perception.

457
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:01,315
I highlight the dynamics of the sexual fact. That means something to you, doesn't it?

458
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:05,576
Frankly, I don't think it does.

459
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:09,838
I give up !

460
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:18,360
Oh God! Who's going to experiment if you lose heart?

461
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:26,882
A flop, friends !

462
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:35,404
I prefer the movies !

463
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:43,926
Well, now what should we do?

464
00:36:48,187 --> 00:36:52,448
Clear out! All of you. Out!

465
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:56,709
What's got into you?

466
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:05,232
All of you! I can't bear the sight of you !

467
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,754
Is that a way to treat your own father?

468
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:18,015
I used to have a father. Not anymore ! I'll have to make myself a father !

469
00:37:18,015 --> 00:37:22,276
You? You make me?

470
00:37:22,276 --> 00:37:26,537
You and the whole lot of you. I'm going to make you all over.

471
00:37:26,537 --> 00:37:30,798
And now get out. This minute!

472
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:35,059
That boy's going just a bit too far.

473
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:39,320
Never mind, Stomil. Thank God, we're enlightened.

474
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,581
You think I should really go?

475
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:47,842
Why not? You're not really interested in anything but your experiments.

476
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:52,103
Ah yes, art! Modern art! Give me God and I'll make an experiment out of Him.

477
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,364
You see ...

478
00:37:56,364 --> 00:38:00,626
G et out !

479
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:04,887
Come on.

480
00:38:09,148 --> 00:38:13,409
Don't forget the cards!

481
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,931
Arthur, If you need anything…

482
00:38:21,931 --> 00:38:26,192
Get out!

483
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:34,714
You're absolutely right, Arthur. Between you and me, they're a bad lot.

484
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:38,975
You too. Out!

485
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:43,236
Certainly. Certainly. I'm going.

486
00:38:43,236 --> 00:38:47,497
I only wanted to tell you that you can count on me.

487
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:51,759
What do you mean?

488
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:56,020
Never mind. Just do what you think right.

489
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,281
But remember. I can be useful to you. I'm not as far gone as the rest of them.

490
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:04,542
I'm an old-timer.

491
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:08,803
Good .

492
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:17,325
I'm an old-timer.

493
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:21,586
But now leave me alone, will you?

494
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:30,108
Reform.

495
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:34,369
Rebirth.

496
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,891
Now I'll explain everything.

497
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:47,153
What do you want to say?

498
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:51,414
Shh… quiet.

499
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:55,675
Why?

500
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:04,197
You think they care what we do.

501
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:08,458
We could climb up the walls and sleep on the ceiling for all they care.

502
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,980
What's wrong?

503
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,241
Stomil pinched me twice today.

504
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:25,502
– The rotte r! – H e's your father!

505
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:29,763
Thank you for reminding me.

506
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:34,024
It sounds so old-fashioned, nobody calls his father a rotter nowadays.

507
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:38,285
– What do you call him then? – Nothing. You just ignore him.

508
00:40:38,285 --> 00:40:42,547
Then I was mistaken.

509
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:46,808
Well, it's your headache that he's your father. Personally, I think he's great.

510
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:51,069
– An artist! – What's wrong with that?

511
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:55,330
Artists are a plague. They were the first to contaminate our society.

512
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,591
Oh, who cares? What did you want me for? It's cold in here. I'm practically naked.

513
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:03,852
Hadn't you noticed?

514
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:08,113
Well, what do you say? Have you thought it over?

515
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:12,374
You mean will I marry you? But I've already told you. I don't see the point.

516
00:41:12,374 --> 00:41:16,635
You mean the answer is no?

517
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:20,896
Why do you get so worked up about it?

518
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,157
I mean--I don't care--if it means so much to you, we can get married tomorrow.

519
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:29,418
We're already cousins.

520
00:41:29,418 --> 00:41:33,680
But I want you to care!

521
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,941
I want you to realize that marriage is something very important.

522
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,202
Important? Why? I don't get it.

523
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:46,463
If I'm going to have a baby it'll be with you, not with the minister.

524
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:50,724
So what's the problem?

525
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:54,985
Well, if it's not important in itself, then we've got to make it important.

526
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:59,246
What for?

527
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:03,507
We derive pleasure from profit and we only profit from doing things we

528
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:07,768
attach importance to--difficult things, the unusual things that seem rare and precious.

529
00:42:07,768 --> 00:42:12,029
And that's why we have to create a system of values.

530
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,290
Philosophy bores me. I think I prefer Stomil.

531
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:20,551
You only think that. Kindly remove that leg.

532
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:24,812
You don't like it?

533
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:29,074
That has nothing whatsoever to do with the subject.

534
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:33,335
Don’t you like it?

535
00:42:33,335 --> 00:42:37,596
Oh, all right, show your leg if you want to.

536
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:41,857
Anyway, your leg only proves my point.

537
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:46,118
My leg?

538
00:42:46,118 --> 00:42:50,379
Yes. Do you know why you're showing your leg?

539
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:54,640
Because I don't leap all over you like my artist father and everybody else does.

540
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,901
That worries you. You were pretty bewildered this morning when

541
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:03,162
we were all alone. You thought you knew what I wanted from you.

542
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:07,423
That's not true.

543
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:11,684
Not true? Ha. You think I didn't see how upset you were

544
00:43:11,684 --> 00:43:15,945
when I proposed marriage instead of just picking you up

545
00:43:15,945 --> 00:43:20,206
and throwing you down on the bed?

546
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:24,468
I had a headache.

547
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:28,729
Headache? Go on. You just couldn't figure out what was going on.

548
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:32,990
T hat you must be losing your charms.

549
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,251
If I suddenly started acting like my father, it would be a relief, wouldn't it?

550
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:41,512
Yes. Except you'd run away, just to get even with me.

551
00:43:41,512 --> 00:43:45,773
I'm running all right.

552
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:50,034
Sit down. I haven't finished yet.

553
00:43:50,034 --> 00:43:54,295
All you care about is your sex appeal. You're so primitive.

554
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:58,556
You can't think about anything else. You don't know anything else!

555
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:02,817
Are you suggesting that I'm backward?

556
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:07,078
– Don't be angry. – What?

557
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:15,601
Aren't you too warm in that blanket?

558
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:19,862
No.

559
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:24,123
Uncle Eugene's hat doesn't look very good on you.

560
00:44:24,123 --> 00:44:28,384
I don't care.

561
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:32,645
Without the right kind of values we can never hope to create a harmonious world

562
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:36,906
or establish the necessary balance between those elements commonly termed good and evil

563
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:41,167
--though of course I use these words in their larger rather than strictly ethical sense.

564
00:44:41,167 --> 00:44:45,428
We must, one, restore the practical relevance of these concepts and,

565
00:44:45,428 --> 00:44:49,689
Secundo… I have to create the rules of action .

566
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:53,950
Arthur, what are you doing?

567
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:02,472
Oh, do excuse me !

568
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:06,733
Eddie, what are you doing here?

569
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:10,995
I was just going to the kitchen for water, pardon, I didn't know you were conversing.

570
00:45:10,995 --> 00:45:15,256
– Water? Water? What for? – Because I'm thirsty, sir.

571
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:19,517
At this hour? In the middle of the night?

572
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:23,778
If that's the way you feel about it, I can go without.

573
00:45:23,778 --> 00:45:28,039
Drink and get out!

574
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:32,300
As you wish.

575
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,561
Hey!

576
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:40,822
Yes, sir?

577
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:45,083
– The kitchen is on the right. – Impossible.

578
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:49,344
I believe I know where the kitchen is in my own house.

579
00:45:53,605 --> 00:45:57,866
You just can't be sure of anything these days.

580
00:45:57,866 --> 00:46:02,128
That idiot! I'll have to take care of him once and for all.

581
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:06,389
Have you finished taking care of me?

582
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:10,650
It's all his fault !

583
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,911
I suppose it was his fault you nearly twisted my arm off.

584
00:46:19,172 --> 00:46:23,433
Does it hurt very much?

585
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:27,694
What do you care?

586
00:46:27,694 --> 00:46:31,955
– Where does it hurt? – Here ...

587
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:36,216
– I'm terribly sorry. – …and here .. .

588
00:46:36,216 --> 00:46:40,477
– Really, I didn't mean to. – …and here ...

589
00:46:40,477 --> 00:46:44,738
Forgive me. I didn't mean to ...

590
00:46:44,738 --> 00:46:48,999
Now you've shown what you really are a brute. First a lot of talk and then the usual.

591
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:53,260
We poor women! Is it our fault we have bodies?

592
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,522
If we could only check them somewhere like a hat or a coat. ..

593
00:46:57,522 --> 00:47:01,783
Then maybe we'd be safe from out sweet-talking cousins.

594
00:47:01,783 --> 00:47:06,044
Frankly, I'm surprised. You with your noble ideals.

595
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:10,305
But really, I…

596
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:14,566
No excuses! You don't think I like a good conversation too?

597
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:18,827
Calmly, without worrying that philosophers will come crawling to my feet.

598
00:47:18,827 --> 00:47:23,088
But never mind. What were we talking about? It was just beginning to be interesting .

599
00:47:23,088 --> 00:47:27,349
Do you seriously think I wanted to rape you?

600
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:31,610
Didn't you?

601
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,871
Certainly not. I was only teaching you a lesson.

602
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:40,132
Thanks. I know that subject.

603
00:47:40,132 --> 00:47:44,393
You can only think about one thing. Then why did you resist?

604
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:48,654
You're vulgar.

605
00:47:48,654 --> 00:47:52,916
Science knows no shame. Why?

606
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:57,177
– Well, why did you attack me? – I was sacrificing myself.

607
00:47:57,177 --> 00:48:01,438
What?

608
00:48:01,438 --> 00:48:05,699
Yes, sacrificing myself in my effort to make certain things clear to you.

609
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:09,960
It was a pure exercise in sexual pragmatics.

610
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,221
Pig ! Scientific pig! Pragmatics? What is it anyway?

611
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:18,482
Some new kind of perversion?

612
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:22,743
There's nothing new about it. Women will follow me.

613
00:48:22,743 --> 00:48:27,004
Which women?

614
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:31,265
All women. Women throughout the world will be my allies.

615
00:48:31,265 --> 00:48:35,526
And once the women are convinced,

616
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:39,787
the men will soon come around.

617
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:44,049
What women? Anybody I know? Anyway, do what you like with them. I don't care.

618
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:48,310
Look. The central fact of history is the total enslavement

619
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:52,571
Of women, children and artists by men.

620
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:56,832
I thought you didn't approve of artists.

621
00:48:56,832 --> 00:49:01,093
That's beside the point. Men don't like artists is that artists aren't men.

622
00:49:01,093 --> 00:49:05,354
And that’s exactly what has always brought them closer to women—unfortunately.

623
00:49:05,354 --> 00:49:09,615
They are generally unfamiliar with concepts like honor, logic, and progress—

624
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:13,876
everything men have invented.

625
00:49:13,876 --> 00:49:18,137
The male half of humanity only realized, and only after great effort and much delay,

626
00:49:18,137 --> 00:49:22,398
that ambiguity, relativity, and oblivion also exist. As well as fleeting illusions.

627
00:49:22,398 --> 00:49:26,659
All of this stands in stark contrast to what man, with his hardened boxer’s skull,

628
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:30,920
imagined at the dawn of time, what he wrote on his banners, and tried for centuries to force

629
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,181
upon women, children, and artists. He created a world in his own image and likeness.

630
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,443
The result was that, in self defense, women, children and artists

631
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,704
closed ranks to form a single community...

632
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:47,965
Sorry. What’s he doing?

633
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:52,226
Maybe he's washing.

634
00:49:52,226 --> 00:49:56,487
Him? Not likely! Let's get back to the subject.

635
00:49:56,487 --> 00:50:00,748
I just don't believe you. I see what you're getting at. You can't fool me.

636
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:05,009
I'm simply trying to make you aware of your own interests as a woman.

637
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:09,270
I want to enlighten you.

638
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:13,531
What does that mean? You want me to strip?

639
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:17,792
Oh, don't be tedious. Once you've finally come to see that

640
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:22,053
our interests coincide, you'll be willing to work with me.

641
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:30,575
What do men want? They want to abolish all conventions relating to sex. And why?

642
00:50:30,575 --> 00:50:34,837
To make life easier for them, to do away with all barriers between desire and satisfaction

643
00:50:34,837 --> 00:50:39,098
It’s the in-between that annoys them.

644
00:50:39,098 --> 00:50:43,359
That’s true. They throw themselves at us like animals.

645
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,620
I’ve just experienced it myself.

646
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,881
I can't deny that as an individual I'm subject to natural drives.

647
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:56,142
But I have a higher goal.

648
00:50:56,142 --> 00:51:00,403
Generally speaking, men have done everything they could to do away with

649
00:51:00,403 --> 00:51:04,664
the last remaining rules governing sexual behavior.

650
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:08,925
I can't believe that women really like it,

651
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:13,186
and that's the basis of my plan.

652
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:17,447
– I like it fine. – That's a lie. You can’t.

653
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:21,708
Yes, I like it. It means I'm free, I can do as I please.

654
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:25,970
For instance, if I take my clothes off right now, what can you do about it?

655
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:30,231
Stop it. This is a serious discussion.

656
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:34,492
Why should I? Who's going to stop me? You? My mother? God?

657
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:38,753
Cover yourself this minute!

658
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:43,014
I will not.

659
00:51:43,014 --> 00:51:47,275
Oh, hi, Eddie. Come on in !

660
00:51:47,275 --> 00:51:51,536
Get out or I'll kill you.

661
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:55,797
Sorry, I thought you’re only having a conversation.

662
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:04,319
Taking your clothes off in front of this… Have you no shame?

663
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:08,580
He may not be very cultured, but he has marvellous eyes.

664
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,841
Eyes like a pig.

665
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:17,102
– I like them. – I'll kill him.

666
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:21,364
– Are you jealous? – I'm not.

667
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:25,625
First he's brutal. Then he's jealous. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

668
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:29,886
Go on then. Undress! I'm not stopping you.

669
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:34,147
I don't feel like it anymore.

670
00:52:34,147 --> 00:52:38,408
– Suit yourself. – I've changed my mind.

671
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:42,669
Oh, you don't. Tell me, why don't you want to anymore!

672
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:46,930
Tell me why you wanted to before.

673
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,191
My God, what a lunatic!

674
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:55,452
Why?

675
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:59,713
– I don't know. – Tell me!

676
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:03,974
What should I say? I don't know,I just don't know.

677
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:08,235
Good. It's because you only pretend to like all this absence of rules,

678
00:53:08,235 --> 00:53:12,497
This debauchery, this promiscuity.

679
00:53:12,497 --> 00:53:16,758
Oh, I only pretend, do I?

680
00:53:16,758 --> 00:53:21,019
Of course. You really hate it, because it's not to your advantage.

681
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:25,280
This lack of forms and norms cuts down your freedom of choice.

682
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,541
There's nothing left for you to do but take off your clothes

683
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:33,802
and put them back on again.

684
00:53:33,802 --> 00:53:38,063
– That's not true. – Then why this sudden modesty?

685
00:53:38,063 --> 00:53:42,324
Now you're being logical. You just said that logic was nonsense.

686
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:46,585
I said that?

687
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:50,846
Yes, only a minute ago. I heard you.

688
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:55,107
You must have heard wrong.

689
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:59,368
I heard you quite clearly.

690
00:53:59,368 --> 00:54:03,629
Doesn’t matter. But I still don't believe you. I'm convinced that the convention

691
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:07,891
of unconventionality goes against your grain. You didn't make it up.

692
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:12,152
Who did then?

693
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:16,413
We, men! You only pretend to like it. And now you're stuck with it,

694
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:20,674
and nobody likes to admit he's just following the herd.

695
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,935
Come on.  I simply refuse to believe that you want to go to bed

696
00:54:24,935 --> 00:54:29,196
with every man in the world.

697
00:54:29,196 --> 00:54:33,457
Let’s say you choose for yourself the best—

698
00:54:33,457 --> 00:54:37,718
one hundred, two hundred, ten thousand, a million, perhaps.

699
00:54:37,718 --> 00:54:41,979
But certainly not all of them. You want to be desired by everyone, yes, of course—

700
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:46,240
that’s different. But you want that so you can exercise the power to choose.

701
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,501
And outside of convention, what real power of selection does a woman have? What?

702
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:54,762
– I'm free. I know exactly what I want. – But you're weak by nature.

703
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:59,023
As much as you don't want to give in to me, if Edek hadn't come in,

704
00:54:59,023 --> 00:55:03,285
you would have had no escape. I'm stronger than you.

705
00:55:03,285 --> 00:55:07,546
I could always take up judo.

706
00:55:07,546 --> 00:55:11,807
It was a metaphor. Can't you women ever understand a general idea?

707
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:16,068
Lots of girls study judo. I'd have you begging for mercy !

708
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:20,329
Excellent. You're getting there. Why does it have to be judo

709
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:24,590
when conventions are quite effective?

710
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:28,851
I'd be kneeling at your feet with a bouquet in my hand begging you

711
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:33,112
to take pity on me, to grant me a ray of hope.

712
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:37,373
Behind a solid wall of conventions, without any wrestling,

713
00:55:37,373 --> 00:55:41,634
without even getting your hair mussed, you'd have me at your mercy.

714
00:55:41,634 --> 00:55:45,895
Wouldn't that be better than judo?

715
00:55:45,895 --> 00:55:50,156
– Really? Down on your knees? – Yes.

716
00:55:50,156 --> 00:55:54,418
-Okay. Go ahead. -What?

717
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:58,679
– Down on your knees. – Impossible.

718
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:02,940
Why?

719
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,201
Because there are no conventions left. Now do you see what a fix you're in?

720
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:11,462
– There’s nothing we can do about it? – It is.

721
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:15,723
What?

722
00:56:15,723 --> 00:56:19,984
Establish new conventions or bring back the old ones.

723
00:56:19,984 --> 00:56:24,245
And that's exactly what I'm going to do with your help.

724
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:28,506
Everything's prepared. All I need is your help.

725
00:56:28,506 --> 00:56:32,767
Great! And you'll really get down on your knees?

726
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:37,028
I will.

727
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:41,289
Now what can I do to help?

728
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:45,550
Marry me. That's the first step. No more promiscuity, no more dolce vita.

729
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:49,812
A real marriage. Not just dropping into city hall

730
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:54,073
between breakfast and lunch.

731
00:56:54,073 --> 00:56:58,334
A genuine wedding with all the ceremony with

732
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:02,595
an organ playing and bridesmaids and so on.

733
00:57:02,595 --> 00:57:06,856
I'm especially counting on the procession. It will take them by surprise.

734
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:11,117
Important is from then on, they won't have time to think, to organize resistance

735
00:57:11,117 --> 00:57:15,378
And spread defeatism. It's the first shot that counts.

736
00:57:15,378 --> 00:57:19,639
Catching them off guard like that, we can force them to accept conventions

737
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:23,900
they'll never breakout of again.

738
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,161
It's going to be the kind of wedding they'll have

739
00:57:28,161 --> 00:57:32,422
to take part in, and on my terms.

740
00:57:32,422 --> 00:57:36,683
I'll turn them into a bridal procession,

741
00:57:36,683 --> 00:57:40,944
and at long last my father will be forced to button his fly.

742
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:45,206
What do you say?

743
00:57:45,206 --> 00:57:49,467
And I'll get to wear a white wedding gown?

744
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:53,728
White as snow. Everything strictly according to the rules. And at the same time

745
00:57:53,728 --> 00:57:57,989
you'll be helping all the women in the world.

746
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:02,250
The rebirth of convention will set them free.

747
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:10,772
– Was somebody listening? – No.

748
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:15,033
I had the feeling there was.

749
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:19,294
Let's settle this matter once and for all. Do you consent?

750
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:23,555
I don't know yet.

751
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:27,816
– I haven't convinced you? – You had.

752
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:32,077
– So? Do you consent? – No...

753
00:58:32,077 --> 00:58:36,339
– Yes or no? – I have to think about it.

754
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:40,600
But what is there to think about? It's as plain as day.

755
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,861
I've got to rebuild a world, and for that I must have a wedding.

756
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:49,122
It's perfectly simple. What don't you understand?

757
00:58:49,122 --> 00:58:53,383
– The whole thing, I guess. – What do you mean?

758
00:58:53,383 --> 00:58:57,644
Wait…

759
00:58:57,644 --> 00:59:01,905
No, I can't wait. There just isn't time. I'll stay here while you go think it over.

760
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:06,166
When you've made up your mind, come back and give me your answer.

761
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:10,427
It's sure to be yes. I've explained everything.

762
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:14,688
And you really have nothing else you want to tell me?

763
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:18,949
Run along now. I'll see you later.

764
00:59:18,949 --> 00:59:23,210
You're throwing me out?

765
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:27,471
No, I have a little private business to attend to.

766
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:31,733
Can't I stay?

767
00:59:31,733 --> 00:59:35,994
No this is a family matter.

768
00:59:35,994 --> 00:59:40,255
All right. Then I'll have my little secrets too. You’ll see.

769
00:59:40,255 --> 00:59:44,516
Yes, yes, but run along now.

770
00:59:48,777 --> 00:59:53,038
– Who's there? – Me.

771
00:59:53,038 --> 00:59:57,299
– Which me? – Your uncle, Eugene.

772
00:59:57,299 --> 01:00:01,560
– Password? – Reform. Answer?

773
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:05,821
Rebirth. All right. Enter, uncle.

774
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:14,343
Oof. I'm exhausted.

775
01:00:18,604 --> 01:00:22,866
Is everything ready?

776
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:27,127
I've brought everything I could down from the attic. You should see the moths!

777
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:31,388
You think, it will work?

778
01:00:31,388 --> 01:00:35,649
It's got to work.

779
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:44,171
I'm worried, worried. They're so demoralized. Think of it. A whole lifetime

780
01:00:44,171 --> 01:00:48,432
in this bawdy-house... Pardon, I meant this atmosphere of moral disintegration.

781
01:00:48,432 --> 01:00:52,693
You see, it's contagious. Forgive me.

782
01:00:52,693 --> 01:00:56,954
Forget it. What's my father doing?

783
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:05,476
He's in his room, working on a new theatre experiment.

784
01:01:05,476 --> 01:01:09,737
Don't you feel sorry for him sometimes, Arthur?

785
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:13,998
After all, he actually believes in that art of his.

786
01:01:13,998 --> 01:01:18,260
Then why do you discourage him?

787
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,521
For spite. To get his goat. But the fact is,

788
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:26,782
those experiments of his don't mean a thing to me. Do you believe in them?

789
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:31,043
I've got other problems. And Mother?

790
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:39,565
Can’t see a thing. Either she's turned off the lights, or she's drawn the curtains.

791
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:48,087
And Grandmother Eugenia?

792
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:52,348
Probably sitting at her mirror, putting on makeup.

793
01:01:52,348 --> 01:01:56,609
Good. You may go now, uncle.

794
01:01:56,609 --> 01:02:00,870
Any further orders?

795
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:05,131
Be vigilant. Eyes open, mouth shut, and ready for action.

796
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:13,654
God protect you, Arthur.

797
01:02:13,654 --> 01:02:17,915
Maybe we'll manage to bring the good old days back again yet.

798
01:02:22,176 --> 01:02:26,437
– Who's there? – Me. Arthur.

799
01:02:30,698 --> 01:02:34,959
– What do you want? – Father, I've got to talk to you.

800
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:39,220
At this time of night? I'm busy. Come back tomorrow.

801
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:43,481
It's urgent.

802
01:02:43,481 --> 01:02:47,742
But I've already told you, I'm busy. You can speak to me tomorrow.

803
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:52,003
What are you doing, father? Stop it! Father, father…

804
01:02:56,264 --> 01:03:00,525
Are you mad? What's going on?

805
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:04,787
Not so loud.

806
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:09,048
Why aren't you in bed?

807
01:03:09,048 --> 01:03:13,309
I can't sleep. It's time to take action.

808
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:17,570
In that case, good night.

809
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:26,092
I only wanted to ask you, Father, doesn't it bother you?

810
01:03:26,092 --> 01:03:30,353
– What? – This thing with Eddie.

811
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:34,614
Eddie? Oh yes, I remember the man.

812
01:03:34,614 --> 01:03:38,875
– What do you think of him? – He's amusing.

813
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:43,136
Amusing? He's repulsive.

814
01:03:43,136 --> 01:03:47,397
You’re exaggerating. Eddie's an unusual type.

815
01:03:47,397 --> 01:03:51,658
From a point of view, he’s expectionally modern.

816
01:03:51,658 --> 01:03:55,919
A very modern, authentic type.

817
01:03:55,919 --> 01:04:00,181
That’s all?

818
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:04,442
You see, our trouble is that we're still too conscious, too cerebral.

819
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:08,703
Enslaved by centuries of culture. Of course we've been doing our best

820
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:12,964
to throw culture off, but we're still a long way from nature.

821
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:17,225
Eddie was born the way we all ought to be.

822
01:04:17,225 --> 01:04:21,486
What comes to him as an innate trait, we can only achieve

823
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:25,747
through great effort and artistry.

824
01:04:25,747 --> 01:04:30,008
That’s why he interests me —as an artist.

825
01:04:30,008 --> 01:04:34,269
I regard him the way a landscape painter regards the landscape."

826
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:38,530
Some landscape!

827
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:42,791
There's been a complete revolution in aesthetics and morality.

828
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:47,052
You keep making me remind you of things that ought to be self-evident.

829
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:51,313
If Eddie shocks us now and then, it's because we're decadent.

830
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:55,575
Sometimes I can't help feeling guilty toward Eddie. But I fight it down.

831
01:04:55,575 --> 01:04:59,836
– And that's all you have to say? – I've been perfectly frank with you.

832
01:04:59,836 --> 01:05:04,097
Then I'll have to start all over again. Why do you tolerate him in your house?

833
01:05:04,097 --> 01:05:08,358
Why not?

834
01:05:08,358 --> 01:05:12,619
He enriches our environment, he gives it a new 'tone,

835
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:16,880
he adds a dash of authenticity. He even stimulates my imagination.

836
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,141
We artists need an exotic touch now and then.

837
01:05:21,141 --> 01:05:25,402
– Then you really don't know? – No, I don't know a thing.

838
01:05:25,402 --> 01:05:29,663
You're lying. You know perfectly well.

839
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:33,924
I repeat--I don't know. I don't want to know.

840
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:42,446
He sleeps with Mother.

841
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:50,969
What’s your opinion, Father?

842
01:05:50,969 --> 01:05:55,230
Let’s admit you’re right , Father .

843
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:59,491
Sexual freedom is the cornerstone of human freedom.

844
01:05:59,491 --> 01:06:03,752
What do you say to that?

845
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:08,013
But it's the truth! They do sleep together!

846
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:12,274
I said we'd assume it's true. What follows? Nothing.

847
01:06:12,274 --> 01:06:16,535
Then you insist on treating it as an abstract hypothesis?

848
01:06:16,535 --> 01:06:20,796
So youáre stubbornly insisting that this is nothing more than an abstract hypothesis,

849
01:06:20,796 --> 01:06:25,057
a wordplay, a product of intellectual imagination?

850
01:06:25,057 --> 01:06:29,318
Why not? I'm no old-fashioned stiff. On an intellectual level,

851
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,579
I’m willing to accept any premise— no matter how delicate or absurd.

852
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:37,840
This is not an intellectual premise. This is the truth.

853
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,102
Do you understand, Father? This is life.

854
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:46,363
The fact remains: you wear horns. Horns that scrape the ceiling.

855
01:06:46,363 --> 01:06:50,624
Horns, horns! That’s a banal metaphor,

856
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:54,885
not the tool of sober intellectual analysis.

857
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:59,146
Let’s not lower our standards!

858
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:03,407
Father, you're a cuckold.

859
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:07,668
Hold your tongue. I forbid you to talk to me like that.

860
01:07:07,668 --> 01:07:11,929
You can't stop me. You're a cuckold.

861
01:07:11,929 --> 01:07:16,190
I can't believe it.

862
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,451
Ha! Now I've got you where I want you. Want me to prove it? Open her door.

863
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:24,712
No!

864
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:28,973
Are you afraid? Of course it's easier to perform theoretical experiments.

865
01:07:28,973 --> 01:07:33,234
When it comes to experiments you're a giant.

866
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:37,496
In real life you're a midget.

867
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:41,757
Me? Midget?

868
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:46,018
A hero in pajamas! A pintsized Agamemnon!

869
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:50,279
I'll show you. You say they're in there?

870
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:54,540
Look for yourself.

871
01:07:54,540 --> 01:07:58,801
I'll show them. I'll show you. I'll show the whole lot of you!

872
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:07,323
I'll take care of this whole thing tomorrow.

873
01:08:07,323 --> 01:08:11,584
Or you know whatI'll do?

874
01:08:11,584 --> 01:08:15,845
Tomorrow! Or by mail. A letter. What do you say?

875
01:08:15,845 --> 01:08:20,106
Phoney!

876
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:24,367
What did you say?

877
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:28,629
– Here I g o! – Just a second. ..

878
01:08:28,629 --> 01:08:32,890
Let me at them.

879
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:37,151
– You'd better take this. – What's that?

880
01:08:37,151 --> 01:08:41,412
You can't go in there bare-handed.

881
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:45,673
Now I see through you.

882
01:08:45,673 --> 01:08:49,934
Get in there! There's not a minute to lose.

883
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:54,195
Now I understand. You want a tragedy!

884
01:08:54,195 --> 01:08:58,456
A tragedy? What do you…

885
01:08:58,456 --> 01:09:02,717
So that's what you're after, you dim little runt of a brainstorm, you…

886
01:09:02,717 --> 01:09:06,978
What are you trying…

887
01:09:06,978 --> 01:09:11,239
You want me to kill him? And then her? And then myself? Right?

888
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:15,500
The injured husband wiping out his shame in blood.

889
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:19,761
Where do you get such ideas? From romantic novels?

890
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:28,284
Father, you know I never .

891
01:09:28,284 --> 01:09:32,545
I always knew the younger generation cared more about ideas than life,

892
01:09:32,545 --> 01:09:36,806
but I never expected my own son to sacrifice his father to an idea.

893
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:41,067
Sit down! And now let’s talk.

894
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:49,589
You want to bring back the old values. What for? Well, never mind that.

895
01:09:49,589 --> 01:09:53,850
That's your business. I've let you talk, I've heard you out

896
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:58,111
but now you're going just a bit too far.

897
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:02,372
How fiendishly clever! So you need a tragedy!

898
01:10:02,372 --> 01:10:06,633
Tragedy has always been the most perfect expression of a society with established values.

899
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:10,894
Instead of the art form you wanted the thing itself.

900
01:10:10,894 --> 01:10:15,156
Or, never mind if somebody's killed, never mind if your own father goes off to prison.

901
01:10:15,156 --> 01:10:19,417
No, all you care about is your idea.

902
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:23,678
You could do with a tragedy, couldn't you?

903
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:27,939
Do you want to know what I think of you? A vulgar formalist.

904
01:10:27,939 --> 01:10:32,200
Your mother mean nothing to you. We can all die as long as form wins out.

905
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,461
And the worst of it is that you don't even care about yourself. You're a fanatic!

906
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:40,722
Maybe my motives aren't as formal as you think.

907
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:44,983
– You dislike Eddie? – I hate him.

908
01:10:44,983 --> 01:10:49,244
Why? Eddie is necessity.

909
01:10:49,244 --> 01:10:53,505
He's the pure truth we've been searching for so long because

910
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:57,766
we always thought it was somewhere else.

911
01:10:57,766 --> 01:11:02,027
Eddie is a fact. You can't hate facts. You've got to accept them.

912
01:11:02,027 --> 01:11:06,288
You cannot hate what is factual. You have to love it.

913
01:11:06,288 --> 01:11:10,550
What? Should I kneel before him? I shall create the necessity.

914
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,811
Good Lord. You talk like a petulant child.

915
01:11:14,811 --> 01:11:19,072
He doesn’t like him… If that’s the case, I can only see one explanation.

916
01:11:19,072 --> 01:11:23,333
It’s all clear! Maybe you've got an Oedipus.

917
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:27,594
A what?

918
01:11:27,594 --> 01:11:31,855
An Oedipus complex, understand? Have you consulted an analyst?

919
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:36,116
No. Mother's wonderful, but that's not it.

920
01:11:36,116 --> 01:11:40,377
Too bad. Then at least we'd know where we were at.

921
01:11:40,377 --> 01:11:44,638
Anything is better than sheer lunacy. I guess you're just a formalist.

922
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:48,899
I am not.

923
01:11:48,899 --> 01:11:53,160
Oh yes you are. And an insufferable and dangerous one at that.

924
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:57,421
It may look that way to you, but the truth is that I just can't go on like this.

925
01:11:57,421 --> 01:12:01,682
I can't live with you people.

926
01:12:01,682 --> 01:12:05,944
I see. That's more like it. In other words, you're an egoist.

927
01:12:05,944 --> 01:12:10,205
Call it whatever you like.

928
01:12:10,205 --> 01:12:14,466
Sacrificing myself - what good would that do you?

929
01:12:14,466 --> 01:12:18,727
Something would be accomplished.

930
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:22,988
Tragedy is a form so vast and powerful that reality

931
01:12:22,988 --> 01:12:27,249
can never escape its grip.

932
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:31,510
You poor devil. You really believe that?

933
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:35,771
Suppose I actually killed him. What would be the good of it?

934
01:12:35,771 --> 01:12:40,032
It would be something irrevocable, masterful, classical.

935
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:44,293
Not for a minute. It would be a farce. In our time only farce is possible.

936
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:48,554
Farse can be also be artistically beautiful!

937
01:12:48,554 --> 01:12:52,815
– Not for me. – Lord, you can be stubborn!

938
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:57,077
I can't help it. I've got to find a way out.

939
01:12:57,077 --> 01:13:01,338
– Regardless of reality? – Yes. At any cost.

940
01:13:05,599 --> 01:13:09,860
That's not so easy. I'd like to help you, but I don't see how.

941
01:13:14,121 --> 01:13:18,382
Couldn't we give it a try?

942
01:13:18,382 --> 01:13:22,643
Give what a try?

943
01:13:22,643 --> 01:13:26,904
With them…

944
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:31,165
You still have illusions?

945
01:13:31,165 --> 01:13:35,426
Even if you're right about farce…

946
01:13:35,426 --> 01:13:39,687
It's only because you people are such cowards.

947
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:43,948
You complain, but you're stuck in a farce.

948
01:13:43,948 --> 01:13:48,209
Because no one has the courage to rebel.

949
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:52,471
To tell you the truth, I don't much care for this kind of thing either.

950
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:56,732
In fact, I detest it. Only the more I think about it, the less I know why.

951
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:00,993
So if I could convince you…

952
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:05,254
I'd be very grateful.

953
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:09,515
And you'd…

954
01:14:09,515 --> 01:14:13,776
Go in and make a scene they'd remember as long as they lived.

955
01:14:13,776 --> 01:14:18,037
But I need a rational justification.

956
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:22,298
Believe it or not, nothing would please me more than to settle his hash.

957
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:26,559
Except that my reason doesn't tell me why.

958
01:14:26,559 --> 01:14:30,820
Father, let me hug you. To hell with reason!

959
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:35,081
What have we got to lose? If the worst comes to the worse, you'll shoot him.

960
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:39,342
Think so? If I could only be sure.

961
01:14:39,342 --> 01:14:43,603
Certainty comes later. The main thing now is to make up your mind.

962
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:47,865
Hm. Maybe you're right…

963
01:14:47,865 --> 01:14:52,126
I know I'm right. You'll see. We'll have our tragedy!

964
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:56,387
You've given me back my strength. The enthusiasm of youth untrammeled

965
01:14:56,387 --> 01:15:00,648
by the skepticism of the times. Ah, youth, youth!

966
01:15:00,648 --> 01:15:04,909
Shall we go in?

967
01:15:04,909 --> 01:15:09,170
Yes. With you beside me, I feel better.

968
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:13,431
Just one more thing. Give up those experiments of yours, will you?

969
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:17,692
They only speed up the process of disintegration.

970
01:15:17,692 --> 01:15:21,953
Well, but what can we do? Tragedy impossible, farce a bore--

971
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:26,214
what's left but experiments?

972
01:15:26,214 --> 01:15:30,475
They only make things worse. Give them up.

973
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:34,736
I don't know…

974
01:15:34,736 --> 01:15:38,998
Promise.

975
01:15:38,998 --> 01:15:43,259
– Later. Now we go in. – I’ll stay at the door and wait here.

976
01:15:43,259 --> 01:15:47,520
If you need any help, just shout.

977
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,781
If anybody yells, it'll be him, not me.

978
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:56,042
Father, I've always had confidence in you.

979
01:15:56,042 --> 01:16:00,303
I believe you. I was the best shot in my regiment. Farewell!

980
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:08,825
No, that's the kitchen.

981
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:13,086
I could use a drink.

982
01:16:13,086 --> 01:16:17,347
Later. When it's all over. No time now.

983
01:16:17,347 --> 01:16:21,608
Right! I'll kill him on the spot. That scoudrel! Now he's going to pay!

984
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:30,130
What's Eddie doing here? Why isn't Eddie?

985
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:34,392
Shhhl Take it easy, boy!

986
01:16:34,392 --> 01:16:38,653
Oh, it's you, Arthur? Are you still up?

987
01:16:38,653 --> 01:16:42,914
I told you he'd find us. He sticks his nose into everything.

988
01:16:42,914 --> 01:16:47,175
Father… You… with them!

989
01:16:47,175 --> 01:16:51,436
That's how it worked out. It's not my fault.

990
01:16:51,436 --> 01:16:55,697
Stomil turned up just in time. We needed a fourth.

991
01:16:55,697 --> 01:16:59,958
Father, how could you…

992
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:04,219
I told you it would end in a farce.

993
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:08,480
Your play, Mr. Stomil. What you got?

994
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,741
Here you are. A harmless pastime. You see the situation. What could I do?

995
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:17,002
But, Father, you promised!

996
01:17:17,002 --> 01:17:21,263
I promised nothing. We'll just have to wait.

997
01:17:21,263 --> 01:17:25,525
Stomil, don’t talk, concentrate.

998
01:17:29,786 --> 01:17:34,047
Shame!

999
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:38,308
I simply can't play under these conditions.

1000
01:17:38,308 --> 01:17:42,569
Can't anybody throw this little twerp out of here?

1001
01:17:42,569 --> 01:17:46,830
Easy, Grandma. Take it easy.

1002
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:51,091
Arthur, you ought to be ashamed, upsetting your grandmother like this.

1003
01:17:51,091 --> 01:17:55,352
I told you we should lock the door.

1004
01:17:55,352 --> 01:17:59,613
He can’t wait for some way to pester me. He'll put me back up on the catafalque!

1005
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:03,874
Oh, no he won't! We've got to finish this rubber first.

1006
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:08,135
– Stop it! – But we've just started.

1007
01:18:08,135 --> 01:18:12,396
Arthur! You'd better listen to your mother.

1008
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:16,657
She's right. Look at the score cards, they're practically blank.

1009
01:18:16,657 --> 01:18:20,919
Now you listen to me! I've got something to tell you. Now! This minute!

1010
01:18:20,919 --> 01:18:25,180
But Arthur, that was strictly between the two of us. Don't shout it from the rooftops.

1011
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:29,441
I pleaded with you. You wouldn't listen. Now I'm going to use force. Stop the game!

1012
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:33,702
What's going on?

1013
01:18:33,702 --> 01:18:37,963
What's got into you anyway? If I were your father, I'd give you a good hiding.

1014
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:42,224
You shut up. Father, the revolver.

1015
01:18:42,224 --> 01:18:46,485
A revolver? I don’t know what you’re talking abput.

1016
01:18:46,485 --> 01:18:50,746
A guy can still make a joke, can't he?

1017
01:18:50,746 --> 01:18:55,007
A revolver? For God's sake, Stomil, don't give it to him.

1018
01:18:55,007 --> 01:18:59,268
Talk to him. Do something. After all, you re his father.

1019
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:03,529
Now see here, Arthur, you're not a child. I'm sorry to have to speak to you like this,

1020
01:19:03,529 --> 01:19:07,790
but out of consideration for mom...

1021
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:12,051
He's gone mad. Stomil, why on earth did you make this child? Criminal negligence!

1022
01:19:12,051 --> 01:19:16,313
You pretend you don’t know?

1023
01:19:16,313 --> 01:19:20,574
Look here, Mr. Arthur…

1024
01:19:20,574 --> 01:19:24,835
Silence! Into the living room, everybody.

1025
01:19:29,096 --> 01:19:33,357
I'll talk to you later.

1026
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:37,618
What's wrong? I did my best.

1027
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:41,879
Your best!

1028
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,401
I did everything I could to quiet him down. You saw me.

1029
01:19:50,401 --> 01:19:54,662
Idiot. And you call yourself a father. Oh, if I were only a manl

1030
01:19:54,662 --> 01:19:58,923
That's easier said than done. You know it’s not possible.

1031
01:19:58,923 --> 01:20:03,184
Has it started yet?

1032
01:20:03,184 --> 01:20:07,446
Not yet. I'm still waiting for an answer.

1033
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:11,707
I thought it had started. I heard a noise and I came running.

1034
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:15,968
That's all right. I'm glad you've come. Stay here and keep an eye on them.

1035
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:20,229
I'll be back in a second.

1036
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:24,490
Am I dreaming?

1037
01:20:24,490 --> 01:20:28,751
Don't let anybody make a move.

1038
01:20:28,751 --> 01:20:33,012
Yes, sir.

1039
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:37,273
It's a plot! Mama, your brother's a gangster!

1040
01:20:37,273 --> 01:20:41,534
Eugene, do put that thing away.

1041
01:20:41,534 --> 01:20:45,795
People don't play cowboys at your age.

1042
01:20:45,795 --> 01:20:50,056
Stay where you are!

1043
01:20:50,056 --> 01:20:54,317
Eugene, it's me—your sister Eugenia.

1044
01:20:54,317 --> 01:20:58,578
When I'm on duty, I have no sister.

1045
01:20:58,578 --> 01:21:02,840
What duty? Don't be a fool.

1046
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,101
I have enlisted in the service of an ideal!

1047
01:21:11,362 --> 01:21:15,623
Splendid. I see I can rely on you. I'm going to leave you for a moment.

1048
01:21:15,623 --> 01:21:19,884
But, Arthur, can't you tell me, what's going on?

1049
01:21:19,884 --> 01:21:24,145
I'll tell you everything in due time.

1050
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:28,406
So that's it… Eugene, you've betrayed us.

1051
01:21:28,406 --> 01:21:32,667
Silence! That's not true, I haven't betrayed anybody.

1052
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:36,928
Ala! Ala!

1053
01:21:36,928 --> 01:21:41,189
You've betrayed your generation.

1054
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:45,450
No, you're the traitors. You've all betrayed our good old days.

1055
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:49,711
I'm the only one who hasn't.

1056
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:53,972
All you are is the tool of a mad pack of young zealots.

1057
01:21:53,972 --> 01:21:58,234
With a missionary complex. ou think you're so clever.

1058
01:21:58,234 --> 01:22:02,495
They'll use you and then kick you out like a dog.

1059
01:22:02,495 --> 01:22:06,756
We'll see who uses whom.

1060
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:11,017
I've been waiting a long time for someone like Arthur to come along.

1061
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:19,539
Now at least you've shown who you really are, you hypocrite.

1062
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:23,800
You've been wearing a mask.

1063
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:28,061
Yes, I have. And all these years I've suffered.

1064
01:22:28,061 --> 01:22:32,322
I hated you for your degradation but I kept quiet because I had to,

1065
01:22:32,322 --> 01:22:36,583
because you were the stronger.

1066
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:40,844
Now at last I can tell you what I think of you!

1067
01:22:40,844 --> 01:22:45,105
What a pleasure!

1068
01:22:45,105 --> 01:22:49,367
What are you going to do to us?

1069
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:53,628
We're going to give you back your dignity. We're going to turn you degenerates

1070
01:22:53,628 --> 01:22:57,889
back into human beings with decent principles.

1071
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:02,150
By force?

1072
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:06,411
If we can't do it any other way, yes.

1073
01:23:06,411 --> 01:23:10,672
– This is a counter-reformation. – But for you it's salvation.

1074
01:23:10,672 --> 01:23:14,933
– Salvation? From what? – From your damnable, diabolical freedom.

1075
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:19,194
– Uncle Eugene! – Sir?

1076
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:23,455
Uncle !

1077
01:23:23,455 --> 01:23:27,716
She's gone.

1078
01:23:27,716 --> 01:23:31,977
Look for her. She must be somewhere.

1079
01:23:31,977 --> 01:23:36,238
Yes. She's got to be. I'm still waiting for her answer.

1080
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:40,499
What? You mean she hasn’t consented yet?

1081
01:23:40,499 --> 01:23:44,761
She's got to. She can't leave me in the lurch at a moment like this.

1082
01:23:44,761 --> 01:23:49,022
I don't mean to criticize you, Arthur, but haven't you rushed things a bit?

1083
01:23:49,022 --> 01:23:53,283
I mean, shouldn't you have made sure of her before starting in on these people?

1084
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:57,544
The time was ripe. I couldn't put it off.

1085
01:23:57,544 --> 01:24:01,805
Well, that's how it is with a coup d'etat. Always some unforeseeable factor.

1086
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:06,066
Still, we can't back out now.

1087
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:10,327
Who could have dreamed of such a thing? I was so sure I had convinced her.

1088
01:24:10,327 --> 01:24:14,588
Ala, Ala! All because of some dumb cousin. Incredible! Ala, Ala.

1089
01:24:14,588 --> 01:24:18,849
Women have been the ruin of kingdoms and empires

1090
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:23,110
Gosh, are you all still up?

1091
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:27,371
At last! I've been looking all over for you.

1092
01:24:27,371 --> 01:24:31,632
What's going on? Uncle with a gun? Is it real? Is Uncle real?

1093
01:24:31,632 --> 01:24:35,893
That's none of your business. Where have you been?

1094
01:24:35,893 --> 01:24:40,155
Out for a walk. Anything wrong with that?

1095
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:44,416
Yes! At this solemn hour, there is.

1096
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:48,677
Steady, Uncle. You're on duty. Well?

1097
01:24:48,677 --> 01:24:52,938
Well, what? It's a lovely night.

1098
01:24:52,938 --> 01:24:57,199
I wasn't asking about the weather. Do you consent?

1099
01:24:57,199 --> 01:25:01,460
I think I need a little more time.

1100
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:05,721
I need an answer immediately. You've had plenty of time.

1101
01:25:05,721 --> 01:25:09,982
Yes.

1102
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:18,504
Thank God! Now we can start!

1103
01:25:22,765 --> 01:25:27,026
Grandmother, your blessing.

1104
01:25:27,026 --> 01:25:31,288
Oh, leave me alone. I haven't done anything to you.

1105
01:25:31,288 --> 01:25:35,549
But Grandmother, everything's changed now. I'm going to marry Ala.

1106
01:25:35,549 --> 01:25:39,810
Give us your blessing.

1107
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:44,071
On your feet, everybody! Can't you see this is a solemn occasion?

1108
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:48,332
My goodness, is Arthur going to get married?

1109
01:25:48,332 --> 01:25:52,593
Is that any reason to make such a fuss?

1110
01:25:52,593 --> 01:25:56,854
Get that boy out of here! He's going to torture me again.

1111
01:25:56,854 --> 01:26:01,115
Grandmother, your blessing.

1112
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:05,376
A tasteless joke. It's gone on long enough now.

1113
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:09,637
The jokes are over now. You've been having your jokes for fifty years.

1114
01:26:09,637 --> 01:26:13,898
Stomil, button your pajamas immediately! Your son has just plighted his troth.

1115
01:26:13,898 --> 01:26:18,159
The day of the wide-open fly is past. Bless them, Eugenia.

1116
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:22,420
What should I do, Eleanor?

1117
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:26,682
Give them your blessing if it means so much to them.

1118
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:30,943
Can't they do without it? It makes me feel so old.

1119
01:26:30,943 --> 01:26:35,204
A good old-fashioned engagement. Give them your blessing, or I'll shoot.

1120
01:26:35,204 --> 01:26:39,465
I'm going to count to three. Three…

1121
01:26:39,465 --> 01:26:43,726
This is incredible. If a man can't be comfortable in his own house...

1122
01:26:43,726 --> 01:26:47,987
Two…

1123
01:26:47,987 --> 01:26:52,248
My blessing upon you, dear children ... and now go to hell!

1124
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:56,509
Just like old times…

1125
01:26:56,509 --> 01:27:00,770
Stomil has buttoned his fly! A whole new era has begun!

1126
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:05,031
Eleonor, are you crying?

1127
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:09,292
Forgive me… But Arthur's getting engaged…

1128
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:13,553
and after all he is our son ...

1129
01:27:13,553 --> 01:27:17,815
I know I'm being terribly old-fashioned, but it's so moving. Forgive me.

1130
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:22,076
Oh, do what you want, all of you!

1131
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:26,337
If you'll permit me, on this joyous occasion I would like to wish the young couple

1132
01:27:26,337 --> 01:27:30,598
all the best for the days to come and especially…

1133
01:27:30,598 --> 01:27:34,859
You! To the kitchen! And stay there until you're called.

1134
01:27:34,859 --> 01:27:39,120
To the kitchen.

1135
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,381
– When's the wedding? – Tomorrow.

1136
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:47,642
Hurray! We' ve won!

1137
01:27:47,642 --> 01:27:51,903
Photo shoot, everyone!

1138
01:27:51,903 --> 01:27:56,164
The groom's relatives, please.

1139
01:28:00,425 --> 01:28:04,686
Don't move!

1140
01:28:08,947 --> 01:28:13,209
I can't help it. It's the moth balls.

1141
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:21,731
Hold it!

1142
01:28:21,731 --> 01:28:25,992
Stomil, your hand.

1143
01:28:25,992 --> 01:28:30,253
But I'm itching all over.

1144
01:28:30,253 --> 01:28:34,514
– Why should you be itching? – Moths.

1145
01:28:34,514 --> 01:28:38,775
At this rate we'll never get a picture. Sit down, Eleanor.

1146
01:28:38,775 --> 01:28:43,036
– The moths come from Mama. – They do not. They come out of this old rag.

1147
01:28:43,036 --> 01:28:47,297
Let's not quarrel. They come from the attic.

1148
01:28:47,297 --> 01:28:51,558
You called, Madame?

1149
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:55,819
What? What is it now? Oh yes. My salts, Edward!

1150
01:28:55,819 --> 01:29:00,080
– What salts, Madame? – Well, my salts… you know.

1151
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:04,341
Certainly, Madame.

1152
01:29:04,341 --> 01:29:08,603
I must admit it's a relief to see that fellow put in his place.

1153
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:12,864
You haven't seen anything yet. You won’t regret it.

1154
01:29:12,864 --> 01:29:17,125
You won't regret a thing.

1155
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:21,386
If only this collar weren’t so damn tight!

1156
01:29:21,386 --> 01:29:25,647
That's the price you've got to pay for having Eddie wait on you.

1157
01:29:25,647 --> 01:29:29,908
Everything has its price.

1158
01:29:29,908 --> 01:29:34,169
And my experiments?

1159
01:29:34,169 --> 01:29:38,430
I couldn't say. Arthur hasn't announced his decision on that point yet.

1160
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:42,691
Maybe he'll let me go on with them. He hasn't said anything?

1161
01:29:42,691 --> 01:29:46,952
There hasn't been time. He went out early this morning.

1162
01:29:46,952 --> 01:29:51,213
Perhaps you could put in a good word for me?

1163
01:29:51,213 --> 01:29:55,474
I'll speak to him when the opportunity arises.

1164
01:29:55,474 --> 01:29:59,736
At least once a week. After all these years

1165
01:29:59,736 --> 01:30:03,997
I can't just suddenly stop. You ought to realize that.

1166
01:30:03,997 --> 01:30:08,258
That will depend entirely on your conductl.

1167
01:30:08,258 --> 01:30:12,519
But I'm on your side. What more do you want?

1168
01:30:12,519 --> 01:30:16,780
I'm even putting up with this collar.

1169
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:21,041
Well, I can't promise.

1170
01:30:25,302 --> 01:30:29,563
What is that?

1171
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:33,824
The salts for Madame, sir..

1172
01:30:33,824 --> 01:30:38,085
Eleanor, what is the meaning of this?

1173
01:30:38,085 --> 01:30:42,346
I can't imagine. I asked for my smelling salts.

1174
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:46,607
Madame no longer drinks?

1175
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:50,868
Take it away immediately!

1176
01:30:50,868 --> 01:30:55,130
As you wish, Madame.

1177
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:59,391
Why? As long as he's brought it . I don't feel too well.

1178
01:30:59,391 --> 01:31:03,652
Don't let it happen again!

1179
01:31:03,652 --> 01:31:07,913
God, am I bored!

1180
01:31:07,913 --> 01:31:12,174
Back to your places! The groom's relatives…

1181
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:20,696
Now the best man... which is me.

1182
01:31:24,957 --> 01:31:29,218
Eugene!

1183
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:37,740
The brides's relatives.

1184
01:31:42,001 --> 01:31:46,262
Can't I unbutton these buttons for just a second?

1185
01:31:46,262 --> 01:31:50,524
Certainly not! The wedding is at twelve!

1186
01:31:54,785 --> 01:31:59,046
I seem to have put on weight. The last time I wore these things was forty years ago.

1187
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:03,307
You have only your experiments to blame for that.

1188
01:32:03,307 --> 01:32:07,568
Experimental art pays so well these days.

1189
01:32:07,568 --> 01:32:11,829
That's not my fault, is it?

1190
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:20,351
When will that picture be ready? I think I blinked. I know I'm going to look awful.

1191
01:32:20,351 --> 01:32:24,612
Don't worry. The camera hasn't worked for years.

1192
01:32:24,612 --> 01:32:28,873
What? Then why take the picture?

1193
01:32:28,873 --> 01:32:33,134
It's the principle of the thing. It's a tradition.

1194
01:32:33,134 --> 01:32:37,395
You begrudge me my innocent experiments but is an old-fashioned

1195
01:32:37,395 --> 01:32:41,657
broken-down camera any better?

1196
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:45,918
Behold the failure of your counter-reform. All you are doing is destroying

1197
01:32:45,918 --> 01:32:50,179
what we have won and still without any result.

1198
01:32:50,179 --> 01:32:54,440
Watch your tongue.

1199
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:58,701
I bow to superior force, but I can still say what I think.

1200
01:32:58,701 --> 01:33:02,962
What do you say?

1201
01:33:02,962 --> 01:33:07,223
I say we're in one hell of a mess and this is only the beginning.

1202
01:33:07,223 --> 01:33:11,484
It can't be helped. Our first job is to create the form. The content comes later.

1203
01:33:11,484 --> 01:33:15,745
You're making a colossal mistake, Eugene.

1204
01:33:15,745 --> 01:33:20,006
Formalism will never free you from chaos.

1205
01:33:20,006 --> 01:33:24,267
You'd be better off if you could just accept the spirit of the times.

1206
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:28,528
That's enough out of you. Defeatism will not be tolerated!

1207
01:33:28,528 --> 01:33:32,789
All right, all right. I can still have an opinion, can't I?

1208
01:33:32,789 --> 01:33:37,051
Of course. As long as it agrees with ours.

1209
01:33:41,312 --> 01:33:45,573
Hear that?

1210
01:33:45,573 --> 01:33:49,834
– Bells… – Wedding bells…

1211
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:58,356
Ah, here comes our dear little bride.

1212
01:33:58,356 --> 01:34:02,617
Oh, Ala, it's so becoming….

1213
01:34:02,617 --> 01:34:06,878
My dear child!

1214
01:34:06,878 --> 01:34:11,139
Isn't Arthur back yet?

1215
01:34:11,139 --> 01:34:15,400
We're expecting him any minute.

1216
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:19,661
He had a few final formalities to attend to.

1217
01:34:19,661 --> 01:34:23,922
These damned formalities.

1218
01:34:23,922 --> 01:34:28,184
The genius of life cannot go about naked.

1219
01:34:28,184 --> 01:34:32,445
It must be clothed, and its appearance must be cared for.

1220
01:34:32,445 --> 01:34:36,706
Didn't Artur mention this to you? Didn't he talk with you about this subject?

1221
01:34:36,706 --> 01:34:40,967
For hours on end.

1222
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:45,228
And rightly so. Someday you'll understand and be grateful to him.

1223
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:49,489
Oh, stop making such an ass of yourself, Uncle.

1224
01:34:49,489 --> 01:34:53,750
You mustn't talk like that, Ala dear. Today is your wedding day

1225
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:58,011
and no time for family quarrels.

1226
01:34:58,011 --> 01:35:02,272
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

1227
01:35:02,272 --> 01:35:06,533
Don't worry. No offense.

1228
01:35:06,533 --> 01:35:10,794
So old and so stupid.

1229
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:15,055
I can understand it in Arthur. But you, Uncle…

1230
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:23,578
He had it coming.

1231
01:35:23,578 --> 01:35:27,839
Forgive her, Eugene. She's so excited she doesn't know what she's saying.

1232
01:35:27,839 --> 01:35:32,100
After all, this is a big day in her life. I remember the day I was married to Stomil…

1233
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:36,361
I can tell when I'm not wanted. But don't delude yourselves.

1234
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:40,622
You can laugh at me as much as you like but childish insults won't change a thing.

1235
01:35:40,622 --> 01:35:44,883
Stomil, come with me. I have a proposition to make to you.

1236
01:35:44,883 --> 01:35:49,144
All right. Just don't try to brainwash me!

1237
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:53,405
I also have something to say.

1238
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:57,666
Mama, you might go for a stroll too.

1239
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:01,927
It's all the same to me. Either way I'll be bored to death.

1240
01:36:01,927 --> 01:36:06,188
Come, granny.

1241
01:36:10,449 --> 01:36:14,710
There. Now we can talk. Tell me, what's happened?

1242
01:36:14,710 --> 01:36:18,972
Nothing.

1243
01:36:18,972 --> 01:36:23,233
Something's bothering you. I can see that.

1244
01:36:23,233 --> 01:36:27,494
Nothing is bothering me.

1245
01:36:31,755 --> 01:36:36,016
This veil doesn't fall quite right.

1246
01:36:36,016 --> 01:36:40,277
You don't have to take that tone with me.

1247
01:36:40,277 --> 01:36:44,538
With the others it's different. They're such fools.

1248
01:36:44,538 --> 01:36:48,799
Why do you all despise each other?

1249
01:36:48,799 --> 01:36:53,060
I don't know. Maybe because we have no reason to respecteach other.

1250
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:57,321
Yourselves or each other?

1251
01:36:57,321 --> 01:37:01,582
It comes to the same thing.

1252
01:37:01,582 --> 01:37:05,843
It's got to be done all over again.

1253
01:37:05,843 --> 01:37:10,105
Are you happy, Mother?

1254
01:37:10,105 --> 01:37:14,366
I beg your pardon?

1255
01:37:14,366 --> 01:37:18,627
I asked if you were happy. What's so funny about that?

1256
01:37:18,627 --> 01:37:22,888
– It's a very indiscreet question. – Why? Is it a disgrace to be happy?

1257
01:37:22,888 --> 01:37:27,149
Then you're not very happy? Because you're ashamed.

1258
01:37:27,149 --> 01:37:31,410
People are always ashamed about not being happy.

1259
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:35,671
It s like having pimples or not doing your homework.

1260
01:37:35,671 --> 01:37:39,932
It makes them feel guilty, almost criminal.

1261
01:37:39,932 --> 01:37:44,193
"It is the right and duty of all to be happy, now that

1262
01:37:44,193 --> 01:37:48,454
The new era has set us free."

1263
01:37:48,454 --> 01:37:52,715
Stomil taught me that.

1264
01:37:52,715 --> 01:37:56,976
Oh. So that's why everybody's so ashamed nowadays.

1265
01:37:56,976 --> 01:38:01,237
But how do you feel about it?

1266
01:38:01,237 --> 01:38:05,499
I've always done as much as I could.

1267
01:38:05,499 --> 01:38:09,760
To make him happy?

1268
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,021
No. Myself. That's the way he wanted it.

1269
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:18,282
Then in a way it was for him?

1270
01:38:18,282 --> 01:38:22,543
Of course it was for him. Oh, if you'd only known him when he was young…

1271
01:38:26,804 --> 01:38:31,065
– May I set the table now? – Sure, Eddie.

1272
01:38:31,065 --> 01:38:35,326
Yes, Edward, you may set the table.

1273
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:39,587
Yes, madame.

1274
01:38:43,848 --> 01:38:48,109
– Does Stomil know? – What?

1275
01:38:48,109 --> 01:38:52,370
Don't be like that. I'm not a baby. Your affair with Eddie.

1276
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:56,631
Of course he knows.

1277
01:38:56,631 --> 01:39:00,893
And what does he say?

1278
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:05,154
Nothing, unfortunately. He pretends not to notice.

1279
01:39:05,154 --> 01:39:09,415
That's bad.

1280
01:39:13,676 --> 01:39:17,937
May I set the table now?

1281
01:39:17,937 --> 01:39:22,198
Edward, set the table.

1282
01:39:26,459 --> 01:39:30,720
Oh, Edek is so simple… like life itself. Crude—but that’s precisely his charm.

1283
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:34,981
He has no complexes.

1284
01:39:34,981 --> 01:39:39,242
He’s refreshing. He knows how to want— truly want—and beautifully so.

1285
01:39:39,242 --> 01:39:43,503
When he sits, he sits like sitting itself: simple, yet perfect.

1286
01:39:43,503 --> 01:39:47,764
When he eats or drinks, his stomach transforms into a symphony of nature.

1287
01:39:52,026 --> 01:39:56,287
I love watching him digest. He does it so simply and sincerely.

1288
01:39:56,287 --> 01:40:00,548
In moments like that, I feel the true delight of contact with nature, with the elements.

1289
01:40:00,548 --> 01:40:04,809
Have you ever noticed how wonderfully he adjusts his trousers?

1290
01:40:04,809 --> 01:40:09,070
It’s almost a royal gesture.

1291
01:40:09,070 --> 01:40:13,331
Stomil admires authenticity too.

1292
01:40:13,331 --> 01:40:17,592
I know. It doesn't fascinate me very much.

1293
01:40:17,592 --> 01:40:21,853
You're too young. You haven't had time to learn the value of genuine simplicity.

1294
01:40:21,853 --> 01:40:26,114
You will. It takes experience.

1295
01:40:26,114 --> 01:40:30,375
I'll try. Tell me, do you think it's a good idea for me to marry Arthur?

1296
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:34,636
Oh, Arthur is something else again. He has principles.

1297
01:40:34,636 --> 01:40:38,897
But Stomil has principles too.

1298
01:40:38,897 --> 01:40:43,158
Oh, those were only opinions. Stomil has always detested principles.

1299
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:47,420
Arthur, on the other hand, has cast-iron principles.

1300
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:51,681
And that's all he has.

1301
01:40:51,681 --> 01:40:55,942
Ala, how can you say a thing like that? Arthur's the first man

1302
01:40:55,942 --> 01:41:00,203
in fifty years to have principles. Doesn't that appeal to you?

1303
01:41:00,203 --> 01:41:04,464
It's so original! And it's so becoming to him!

1304
01:41:04,464 --> 01:41:08,725
I'll take Arthur with principles if I have to, Mother.

1305
01:41:08,725 --> 01:41:12,986
But principles without Arthur--no.

1306
01:41:12,986 --> 01:41:17,247
Isn't he going to marry you?

1307
01:41:17,247 --> 01:41:21,508
Not Arthur.

1308
01:41:21,508 --> 01:41:25,769
Then who?

1309
01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:30,030
His principles!

1310
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:34,291
Then why did you accept?

1311
01:41:34,291 --> 01:41:38,553
Because I still have hope.

1312
01:41:38,553 --> 01:41:42,814
Fatal.

1313
01:41:42,814 --> 01:41:47,075
May I continue?

1314
01:41:47,075 --> 01:41:51,336
Clatter away, Eddie boy. I mean, yes, Edward, do continue, Edward.

1315
01:41:51,336 --> 01:41:55,597
Tell me, Eddie, does it depress you? I’m sorry,

1316
01:41:55,597 --> 01:41:59,858
but all this overthrow ... thought up by a bunch of fools?

1317
01:41:59,858 --> 01:42:04,119
Why should it depress me?

1318
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:08,380
Didn't I tell you? He's as free and natural as a butterfly.

1319
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:12,641
Oh, Eddie, you set the table so gracefully.

1320
01:42:16,902 --> 01:42:21,163
– Why should I act like a fool? – Eddie, come here.

1321
01:42:25,424 --> 01:42:29,685
At your service.

1322
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:33,947
Tell me, have you got principles?

1323
01:42:33,947 --> 01:42:38,208
Principles? Sure.

1324
01:42:38,208 --> 01:42:42,469
– What kind? – The best.

1325
01:42:42,469 --> 01:42:46,730
– Tell me one. Please. – What's in it for me?

1326
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:50,991
Well, can you or can't you?

1327
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:59,513
If I have to, I guess. Just a sec. I wrote them down. Here it is!

1328
01:42:59,513 --> 01:43:03,774
"I love you, and you're sound sleep."

1329
01:43:03,774 --> 01:43:08,035
– That's all? – "You made your bed, now lie in it."

1330
01:43:08,035 --> 01:43:12,296
– Oh, come on, Eddie. Read. – I did read. That's a principle.

1331
01:43:12,296 --> 01:43:16,557
Then read another!

1332
01:43:16,557 --> 01:43:20,818
What's so funny?

1333
01:43:20,818 --> 01:43:25,079
Well, there's one here…

1334
01:43:25,079 --> 01:43:29,341
Read it!

1335
01:43:29,341 --> 01:43:33,602
I can't, not in mixed company. It's too good.

1336
01:43:37,863 --> 01:43:42,124
And those are your principles?

1337
01:43:42,124 --> 01:43:46,385
Actually, no. I borrowed them from a friend who works for the movies.

1338
01:43:46,385 --> 01:43:50,646
– You haven't got any of your own? – No.

1339
01:43:50,646 --> 01:43:54,907
Why not?

1340
01:43:54,907 --> 01:43:59,168
What do I need them for? I know my way around.

1341
01:43:59,168 --> 01:44:03,429
Oh yes, Eddie. You certainly do.

1342
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:11,951
No, no! That's asking too much.

1343
01:44:11,951 --> 01:44:16,212
Take my word for it. You'll be glad once it's on.

1344
01:44:16,212 --> 01:44:20,474
Now what's wrong?

1345
01:44:20,474 --> 01:44:24,735
He wants to strap me into that thing.

1346
01:44:24,735 --> 01:44:28,996
What is it?

1347
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:33,257
Great grandfather's corset. Indispensable.

1348
01:44:33,257 --> 01:44:37,518
Pulls in the waist, guarantees a perfect figure for every occasion.

1349
01:44:37,518 --> 01:44:41,779
No, no, no. I'm wearing spats, I've got this collar on.

1350
01:44:41,779 --> 01:44:46,040
What are you trying to do--kill me?

1351
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:50,301
Now, let's not do things by halves.

1352
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:54,562
I've gone far enough. Let me live!

1353
01:44:54,562 --> 01:44:58,823
You're falling back into your old habits, Stomil. Stop making such a fuss.

1354
01:44:58,823 --> 01:45:03,084
You admitted yourself you'd been putting on weight.

1355
01:45:03,084 --> 01:45:07,345
But I want to be fat! I want to live in harmony with nature!

1356
01:45:07,345 --> 01:45:11,606
So you want an easy life . Don't fight it , accept it.

1357
01:45:11,606 --> 01:45:15,868
Nora, save me!

1358
01:45:15,868 --> 01:45:20,129
You don't think it might improve your looks?

1359
01:45:20,129 --> 01:45:24,390
My looks? What for? I'm a free fat artist.

1360
01:45:28,651 --> 01:45:32,912
These perpetual scenes. And you say you still have hope?

1361
01:45:32,912 --> 01:45:37,173
Yes.

1362
01:45:37,173 --> 01:45:41,434
Poor Ala…

1363
01:45:41,434 --> 01:45:45,695
And if you're only deluding yourself?

1364
01:45:45,695 --> 01:45:49,956
– That's my secret. – You won't tell even me?

1365
01:45:49,956 --> 01:45:54,217
It will be a surprise.

1366
01:45:54,217 --> 01:45:58,478
Uncle Eugene is really overdoing it.

1367
01:45:58,478 --> 01:46:02,739
Do you think he has any influence on Arthur?

1368
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:07,000
I doubt it. It's probably the other way around.

1369
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,262
Too bad. I thought it was all Uncle's fault.

1370
01:46:11,262 --> 01:46:15,523
I'd better go see what they're up to. I have a feeling something

1371
01:46:15,523 --> 01:46:19,784
is going to happen.

1372
01:46:19,784 --> 01:46:24,045
So do I.

1373
01:46:24,045 --> 01:46:28,306
Careful, Ala.

1374
01:46:28,306 --> 01:46:32,567
Don't go too far— like Uncle Eugene.

1375
01:46:36,828 --> 01:46:41,089
Eddie, my veil!

1376
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:49,611
What's going on?

1377
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:53,872
You’re late.

1378
01:46:58,133 --> 01:47:02,395
Let him go.

1379
01:47:02,395 --> 01:47:06,656
Why? It would have given him that final polish.

1380
01:47:06,656 --> 01:47:10,917
I said let him go.

1381
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:19,439
Thank you, Arthur. I'm glad to see you still have human feeling.

1382
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:23,700
I protest !

1383
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:27,961
Arthur, what's happened? He's as pale as a ghost !

1384
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:32,222
You whited skeleton ...

1385
01:47:32,222 --> 01:47:36,483
Arthur, it's me, it's your Uncle Eugene! Don't you know me?

1386
01:47:36,483 --> 01:47:40,744
You're choking me. You and I…. together… Don't…

1387
01:47:40,744 --> 01:47:45,005
You stuffed zero, you synthetic blob , you worm-eaten false bottom!

1388
01:47:45,005 --> 01:47:49,266
Do something! He's choking him!

1389
01:47:49,266 --> 01:47:53,527
You fake !

1390
01:47:53,527 --> 01:47:57,789
– Do you wish me to change the record? – Who told you to put that on?

1391
01:47:57,789 --> 01:48:02,050
Mr. Eugene. His orders were to put it on as soon as Mr. Arthur entered the room.

1392
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:06,311
– Yes ... that's right. .. – We won't need music right now.

1393
01:48:06,311 --> 01:48:10,572
The whole thing... a fraud!

1394
01:48:10,572 --> 01:48:14,833
He's dead drunk.

1395
01:48:14,833 --> 01:48:19,094
That's a slander, an infamous slander. This young man knows his duty.

1396
01:48:19,094 --> 01:48:23,355
I can't believe it either. Arthur never drinks.

1397
01:48:23,355 --> 01:48:27,616
Take it from me. I'm an expert.

1398
01:48:27,616 --> 01:48:31,877
But why today of all days?

1399
01:48:31,877 --> 01:48:36,138
His last hours as a free man.

1400
01:48:36,138 --> 01:48:40,399
There must be some misunderstanding. Let's not jump to conclusions.

1401
01:48:40,399 --> 01:48:44,660
The truth will soon be known.

1402
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:48,921
Yes. Wait, he'll explain. He was just getting started.

1403
01:48:48,921 --> 01:48:53,183
H e's coming to.

1404
01:48:57,444 --> 01:49:01,705
What is that?

1405
01:49:01,705 --> 01:49:05,966
He doesn't know his own father. What a misfortune!

1406
01:49:05,966 --> 01:49:10,227
Quiet, you females! It's not my parents I'm asking about.

1407
01:49:10,227 --> 01:49:14,488
What's the meaning of this masquerade?

1408
01:49:14,488 --> 01:49:18,749
These... these are spats.

1409
01:49:18,749 --> 01:49:23,010
Oh .. . of course. . t hey're spats.

1410
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:27,271
Arthur's a little tired. Conditions will return to normal in a moment.

1411
01:49:31,532 --> 01:49:35,793
Take your places. Attention!

1412
01:49:35,793 --> 01:49:40,054
There will be no change in the program.

1413
01:49:40,054 --> 01:49:44,316
Ha ha, well, Arthur, my boy, you were just joking, weren't you?

1414
01:49:44,316 --> 01:49:48,577
Putting us to the test, you little devil. Don't worry.

1415
01:49:48,577 --> 01:49:52,838
We won't abandon out positions.

1416
01:49:52,838 --> 01:49:57,099
Here we are, all buttoned up from top to toe, once and for all.

1417
01:49:57,099 --> 01:50:01,360
Cheer up, my boy. A little rest, and then ... on with the wedding!

1418
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:05,621
Can't you see that he's been pillaged like a pig, ghost of the past?

1419
01:50:05,621 --> 01:50:09,882
My blood, my blood!

1420
01:50:09,882 --> 01:50:14,143
That's a lie! Quiet! Come on, Arthur. It's time for action now.

1421
01:50:14,143 --> 01:50:18,404
Just one last step. ..

1422
01:50:22,665 --> 01:50:26,926
– Father, forgive me. – What's this? Some new trick?

1423
01:50:26,926 --> 01:50:31,187
I was insane!

1424
01:50:31,187 --> 01:50:35,448
There's no going back, no present, no past. Nothing!

1425
01:50:35,448 --> 01:50:39,710
What is he now? A nihilist?

1426
01:50:39,710 --> 01:50:43,971
What about me? Am I nothing?

1427
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:48,232
You too… forgive me!

1428
01:50:48,232 --> 01:50:52,493
You're a coward, that's all you are.

1429
01:50:52,493 --> 01:50:56,754
No, please don't say that. I'm not afraid, but I can't believe anymore.

1430
01:50:56,754 --> 01:51:01,015
I'll lay down my life but there's no turning back to the old forms.

1431
01:51:01,015 --> 01:51:05,276
They can't create a reality for us. I was wrong.

1432
01:51:05,276 --> 01:51:09,537
– What are you talking about? – About creating a world.

1433
01:51:09,537 --> 01:51:13,798
And me? Isn't anybody going to say anything about me?

1434
01:51:13,798 --> 01:51:18,059
This is treason!

1435
01:51:18,059 --> 01:51:22,320
You must forgive me too. I raised your hopes and I ve let you down.

1436
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:26,581
But believe me, it's impossible…

1437
01:51:26,581 --> 01:51:30,843
I refuse to listen to this kind of talk. Pull yourself together!

1438
01:51:30,843 --> 01:51:35,104
Stand up and get married. Raise a family, brush your teeth,

1439
01:51:35,104 --> 01:51:39,365
eat with a knife and fork,

1440
01:51:39,365 --> 01:51:43,626
Let the world stand up again, not upside down! You'll see, we'll make it.

1441
01:51:43,626 --> 01:51:47,887
You re not going to throw away our last chance, are you.

1442
01:51:47,887 --> 01:51:52,148
There never was a chance. We were wrong. It's hopeless.

1443
01:51:56,409 --> 01:52:00,670
Stomil's right. You're drunk. You don't know what you're saying.

1444
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:04,931
Yes, drunk. When I was sober I let myself be deceived,

1445
01:52:04,931 --> 01:52:09,192
so I got drunk to dispel my illusions. You'd better have a drink too, Uncle.

1446
01:52:09,192 --> 01:52:13,453
Me? Certainly not… Well, perhaps just a little one.

1447
01:52:13,453 --> 01:52:17,714
I had cold sober reasons for getting drunk. I drank myself sane again.

1448
01:52:17,714 --> 01:52:21,975
Nonsense. You got drunk out of despair.

1449
01:52:21,975 --> 01:52:26,237
Yes, despair too. Despair that form can never save the world.

1450
01:52:26,237 --> 01:52:30,498
– Then what can? – An ideal !

1451
01:52:30,498 --> 01:52:34,759
What idea?

1452
01:52:34,759 --> 01:52:39,020
If I only know ! Conventions always spring from an idea. Father was right.

1453
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:43,281
I'm a contemptible formalist.

1454
01:52:43,281 --> 01:52:47,542
Don't take it so hard, son. You know I've always been indulgent.

1455
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:51,803
Frankly, though, I've suffered plenty from your ideas.

1456
01:52:51,803 --> 01:52:56,064
Thank God, that's all over now. Where are my pajamas?

1457
01:52:56,064 --> 01:53:00,325
Stop ! A reversion to pajamas is equally impossible.

1458
01:53:00,325 --> 01:53:04,586
Why? Are you still trying to save us?

1459
01:53:04,586 --> 01:53:08,847
I thought you'd got over that.

1460
01:53:08,847 --> 01:53:13,108
Did you think I was going to cave in completely just like that?

1461
01:53:13,108 --> 01:53:17,369
Just a minute ago you were acting like a human being.

1462
01:53:17,369 --> 01:53:21,631
Don't tell me you want to be an apostle again.

1463
01:53:21,631 --> 01:53:25,892
I gave you the epolons of your lost dignity, and I'm tearing them off!

1464
01:53:25,892 --> 01:53:30,153
Same hand! You want repentance?

1465
01:53:30,153 --> 01:53:34,414
I knelt before you here. My sin was rooted in reason—

1466
01:53:34,414 --> 01:53:38,675
and abstraction, the lost daughter of reason.

1467
01:53:38,675 --> 01:53:42,936
But now I have conquered my reason with darkness.

1468
01:53:42,936 --> 01:53:47,197
I didn’t simply drink myself into a stupor—

1469
01:53:47,197 --> 01:53:51,458
I did so knowingly, even if my intention was mystical.

1470
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:55,719
The fiery ecstasy has purified me.

1471
01:53:55,719 --> 01:53:59,980
And so, you must forgive me, for now I stand before you cleansed.

1472
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:04,241
I was the one who clothed you in your garments—

1473
01:54:04,241 --> 01:54:08,502
and I was the one who tore them from you,

1474
01:54:08,502 --> 01:54:12,764
for they turned out to be shrouds.

1475
01:54:12,764 --> 01:54:17,025
But I will not leave you naked, exposed to the winds of history,

1476
01:54:17,025 --> 01:54:21,286
even if you curse me to the very depths of my soul. Eddie!

1477
01:54:25,547 --> 01:54:29,808
At your service.

1478
01:54:29,808 --> 01:54:34,069
Shut the door !

1479
01:54:34,069 --> 01:54:38,330
Yes, Eddie, shut the door, there's a draft.

1480
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,591
– Don't let anybody leave. – Okay, boss.

1481
01:54:46,852 --> 01:54:51,113
This is a violation of civil rights .

1482
01:54:51,113 --> 01:54:55,374
You want freedom? There is no freedom from life, and life is synthesis.

1483
01:54:55,374 --> 01:54:59,635
You'd analyze yourselves to death. Luckily, however, you have me.

1484
01:54:59,635 --> 01:55:03,896
Arthur, you know I don't agree with Stomil. But aren't you going a little too far?

1485
01:55:03,896 --> 01:55:08,158
I feel it's my duty to warn you in spite of everything,

1486
01:55:08,158 --> 01:55:12,419
I stand by the freedom of the individual.

1487
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:20,941
Now what we need is to find an idea.

1488
01:55:20,941 --> 01:55:25,202
Is this; any way to treat your father?

1489
01:55:25,202 --> 01:55:29,463
I wash my hands of the whole business.

1490
01:55:29,463 --> 01:55:33,724
Arthur, lie down for a while. I'll make you a nice cold compress.

1491
01:55:33,724 --> 01:55:37,985
Until we come up with an idea, nobody leaves this room. Eddie. Guard the door!

1492
01:55:37,985 --> 01:55:42,246
Yes, sir.

1493
01:55:42,246 --> 01:55:46,507
Find him an idea, somebody, so he'll leave us alone. If

1494
01:55:46,507 --> 01:55:50,768
I don't go to the kitchen, the cake will be burned to a crisp.

1495
01:55:55,029 --> 01:55:59,290
Maybe it's better not to go against them ... There are two of them.

1496
01:55:59,290 --> 01:56:03,552
What do you suggest, Uncle?

1497
01:56:03,552 --> 01:56:07,813
Search me… God, maybe?

1498
01:56:07,813 --> 01:56:12,074
That's been done. Lost His appeal.

1499
01:56:12,074 --> 01:56:16,335
True. Even in my time there wasn't much you could do with God.

1500
01:56:16,335 --> 01:56:20,596
I grew up in an age of enlightenment and exact science.

1501
01:56:20,596 --> 01:56:24,857
I only mentioned Him for the sake of form.

1502
01:56:24,857 --> 01:56:29,118
Forget about form. What we're after now is a living idea.

1503
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:33,379
How about sports? I used to ride horseback.

1504
01:56:33,379 --> 01:56:37,640
Everybody goes in for sports nowadays. A lot of good it does them.

1505
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:41,901
Sorry. Maybe Stomil has an idea.

1506
01:56:46,162 --> 01:56:50,423
So?

1507
01:56:50,423 --> 01:56:54,685
Experiment. There's an idea.

1508
01:56:54,685 --> 01:56:58,946
Please, this is serious.

1509
01:56:58,946 --> 01:57:03,207
Well, I'm serious too. Blazing trails, opening new frontiers!

1510
01:57:03,207 --> 01:57:07,468
Man is always looking for new worlds to conquer comes from experiment.

1511
01:57:07,468 --> 01:57:11,729
From trial and error. But always with an aim in view: The new life, radically new!

1512
01:57:11,729 --> 01:57:15,990
A new life! I don't even know what to do with the old one,

1513
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:20,251
but Father is talking about a new life. This is just too much.

1514
01:57:20,251 --> 01:57:24,512
Well, everything is still in the experimental stage, that's why.

1515
01:57:24,512 --> 01:57:28,773
Eleanor, have you got an idea?

1516
01:57:28,773 --> 01:57:33,034
There's no sense asking a woman.

1517
01:57:33,034 --> 01:57:37,295
I had one once, but I forgot. With a whole household on my head!

1518
01:57:37,295 --> 01:57:41,556
Why don't you ask Eddie? He s got a good head on his shoulders

1519
01:57:41,556 --> 01:57:45,817
When he does say something, you can depend on it.

1520
01:57:45,817 --> 01:57:50,079
That's right. Eddie is the collective mind.

1521
01:57:54,340 --> 01:57:58,601
Eddie?

1522
01:57:58,601 --> 01:58:02,862
I'd say progress, sir.

1523
01:58:02,862 --> 01:58:07,123
– Meaning what? – Well, just that, sir: progress.

1524
01:58:07,123 --> 01:58:11,384
But what kind of progress?

1525
01:58:11,384 --> 01:58:15,645
The progressive kind, the kind that goes right ahead.

1526
01:58:15,645 --> 01:58:19,906
You mean forward?

1527
01:58:19,906 --> 01:58:24,167
Right. With the front moving forward.

1528
01:58:24,167 --> 01:58:28,428
Then the front is in back?

1529
01:58:28,428 --> 01:58:32,689
Depends on how you look at it.

1530
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:36,950
If you look from back to front, the front is in front,

1531
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:41,212
though somehow or other it's also in back.

1532
01:58:41,212 --> 01:58:45,473
That doesn't sound very clear to me.

1533
01:58:45,473 --> 01:58:49,734
But it's progressive , sir .

1534
01:58:49,734 --> 01:58:53,995
There's something I must tell you…

1535
01:58:53,995 --> 01:58:58,256
Not now, Mother. Can't you see the men are discussing politics?

1536
01:58:58,256 --> 01:59:02,517
Just two words…

1537
01:59:02,517 --> 01:59:06,778
No, I don't like it. I need an idea that naturally, inevitably, leads to form.

1538
01:59:06,778 --> 01:59:11,039
Progress of this kind does nothing but confuse. It's amorphous.

1539
01:59:11,039 --> 01:59:15,300
Please listen to me, my darlings. I won't take much of your time.

1540
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:19,561
What is it now?

1541
01:59:19,561 --> 01:59:23,822
I don't know. Something's wrong with Mama.

1542
01:59:23,822 --> 01:59:28,083
Later. We're busy now. I still say we should

1543
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:32,344
get back to experiments. Then the idea will come by itself.

1544
01:59:36,606 --> 01:59:40,867
What are you doing, Mama?

1545
01:59:45,128 --> 01:59:49,389
I'm dying.

1546
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:57,911
Mother! That's not very funny, you know. Mother says she's dying.

1547
01:59:57,911 --> 02:00:02,172
What? Dying? Can't she see we're busy?

1548
02:00:02,172 --> 02:00:06,433
Did you hear that, Mama?

1549
02:00:06,433 --> 02:00:10,694
Help me.

1550
02:00:14,955 --> 02:00:19,216
But don't be silly, Mama. There's going to be a wedding today.

1551
02:00:19,216 --> 02:00:23,477
You wouldn't want to spoil everything by dying, would you?

1552
02:00:23,477 --> 02:00:27,738
Dying? What's all this about death? I never thought about that…

1553
02:00:27,738 --> 02:00:32,000
Death? Excellent idea!

1554
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,261
This is ridiculous, Eugenia. Pull yourself together. Thisis no way to behave.

1555
02:00:36,261 --> 02:00:40,522
It wouldn't be normal, Grandmother.

1556
02:00:44,783 --> 02:00:49,044
You're all so intelligent,

1557
02:00:49,044 --> 02:00:53,305
but if somebody wants to do something as simple as dying,

1558
02:00:53,305 --> 02:00:57,566
you don't know what to make of it. Really, you are very strange people.

1559
02:01:01,827 --> 02:01:06,088
Look at her. Do something. Maybe she's really…

1560
02:01:06,088 --> 02:01:10,349
Eugenia, this is carrying eccentricity too far. This sort of thing isn't done in our family.

1561
02:01:10,349 --> 02:01:14,610
This has never happened in our family!

1562
02:01:14,610 --> 02:01:18,871
No, enough! It's sheer hypocrisy.

1563
02:01:18,871 --> 02:01:23,133
Death… the supreme form.

1564
02:01:27,394 --> 02:01:31,655
You'll find the key to my room on the table I won't need it anymore. Now I'm leaving.

1565
02:01:31,655 --> 02:01:35,916
The cards are in the drawer. All marked.

1566
02:01:35,916 --> 02:01:40,177
Death … the supreme form!

1567
02:01:40,177 --> 02:01:44,438
Not exactly viable, though, is it?

1568
02:01:44,438 --> 02:01:48,699
Why not? When it's somebody else's death. Grandma, you're brilliant!

1569
02:01:48,699 --> 02:01:52,960
You ought to be ashamed of yourself! You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

1570
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:57,221
Eugenia, lie properly at least. Or get up this minute .

1571
02:01:57,221 --> 02:02:01,482
Dying is not a way to behave in society

1572
02:02:01,482 --> 02:02:05,743
Stop! Can't you see what's happening?

1573
02:02:05,743 --> 02:02:10,004
I don’t care about good manners, but from the standpoint of the experiment,

1574
02:02:10,004 --> 02:02:14,265
death is out of the question— it's an irreversible act.

1575
02:02:14,265 --> 02:02:18,527
The fundamental condition of any experiment is repeatability.

1576
02:02:18,527 --> 02:02:22,788
Unless, of course, it’s some sort of trial étude Mama is performing.

1577
02:02:22,788 --> 02:02:27,049
But even then, we do not approve.

1578
02:02:27,049 --> 02:02:31,310
Come closer, my children.

1579
02:02:35,571 --> 02:02:39,832
Eddie, you tool

1580
02:02:44,093 --> 02:02:48,354
Who are you?

1581
02:02:52,615 --> 02:02:56,876
We’re ... just us.

1582
02:03:01,137 --> 02:03:05,398
Now she's insulting us. Did I say something funny?

1583
02:03:05,398 --> 02:03:09,659
I'm not feeling so well myself.

1584
02:03:09,659 --> 02:03:13,921
Must be a headache.

1585
02:03:13,921 --> 02:03:18,182
Nothing serious, I guess. Must be these tight clothes.

1586
02:03:22,443 --> 02:03:26,704
Try again, Mama.

1587
02:03:30,965 --> 02:03:35,226
She's dead.

1588
02:03:39,487 --> 02:03:43,748
Strange. She was always so frivolous.

1589
02:03:43,748 --> 02:03:48,009
I dont want it!

1590
02:03:48,009 --> 02:03:52,270
I don't understand.

1591
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:56,531
I don't want to have anything to do with this.

1592
02:03:56,531 --> 02:04:00,792
I never dreamed… Stomil, why didn't you warn me?

1593
02:04:00,792 --> 02:04:05,054
Of course, it's all my fault. Frankly I don't see that this changes anything at all.

1594
02:04:05,054 --> 02:04:09,315
My collar's as tight as ever.

1595
02:04:13,576 --> 02:04:17,837
Eddie, come here !

1596
02:04:22,098 --> 02:04:26,359
You pack a good punch, don't you?

1597
02:04:26,359 --> 02:04:30,620
Not bad, sir.

1598
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:34,881
And if necessary, you could…?

1599
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:39,142
You ask me a question, Mr. Arthur? I'm not sure I heard you right.

1600
02:04:43,403 --> 02:04:47,664
Eddie, I like you. I've always liked you.

1601
02:04:47,664 --> 02:04:51,925
And I've always thought we'd understand each other someday.

1602
02:04:51,925 --> 02:04:56,186
Then you do understand?

1603
02:04:56,186 --> 02:05:00,448
Eddie understands all right.

1604
02:05:00,448 --> 02:05:04,709
This business has rather upset me. I'm going to lie down for a while.

1605
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:08,970
Stay right where you are, Father.

1606
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:13,231
Oh stop ordering me around, you little punk. I'm tired.

1607
02:05:13,231 --> 02:05:17,492
Who do you think you are?

1608
02:05:17,492 --> 02:05:21,753
And you've been having an affair with this flunky?

1609
02:05:21,753 --> 02:05:26,014
For God's sake, not now. Not with Mama lying there.

1610
02:05:26,014 --> 02:05:30,275
Patience. Now all is clear. Follow me to the happy future.

1611
02:05:30,275 --> 02:05:34,536
I just don't seem to care anymore. I must be getting old.

1612
02:05:34,536 --> 02:05:38,797
We're just not as young as we used to be, are we, Stomil? What do you think?

1613
02:05:38,797 --> 02:05:43,058
Speak for yourself. You're almost as old as Eugenia was, you old hypocrite.

1614
02:05:43,058 --> 02:05:47,319
I feel fine. By and large. Eleanor, where are you?

1615
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:51,580
– Here, Stomil, right beside you. – Come here.

1616
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:55,842
– How do you feel? – I feel some kind of ending…

1617
02:05:55,842 --> 02:06:00,103
Uncertainty and indecision are behind us now.

1618
02:06:00,103 --> 02:06:04,364
Now the road lies before us, straight and clear.

1619
02:06:04,364 --> 02:06:08,625
From now on there will be only one law and one herd.

1620
02:06:08,625 --> 02:06:12,886
What's he jabbering about now? Oh, my head!

1621
02:06:12,886 --> 02:06:17,147
Something about a new legal code for livestock.

1622
02:06:17,147 --> 02:06:21,408
Do you understand now what the final conclusion is? Ah, of course not —

1623
02:06:21,408 --> 02:06:25,669
you, beings of flesh, you're only concerned with your glands,

1624
02:06:25,669 --> 02:06:29,930
you fear for your immortality.

1625
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:34,191
But I understand! B ehold your redeemer!

1626
02:06:34,191 --> 02:06:38,452
I have risen above this world, and I will draw you all up after me,

1627
02:06:38,452 --> 02:06:42,713
because I alone have a brain freed from the snares of the bowels. I...

1628
02:06:42,713 --> 02:06:46,975
My dear great-nephew,

1629
02:06:46,975 --> 02:06:51,236
kindly express yourself more clearly.

1630
02:06:51,236 --> 02:06:55,497
Won't you ever understand, you whose lives rot away like mushrooms?

1631
02:06:55,497 --> 02:06:59,758
You're like blind puppies that would walk in circles forever

1632
02:06:59,758 --> 02:07:04,019
if they had no master to lead them.

1633
02:07:04,019 --> 02:07:08,280
Without form or ideas, you would crumble to chaos and be consumed

1634
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:12,541
by the void if I weren't on hand to save you.

1635
02:07:12,541 --> 02:07:16,802
Do you know what I'm going to do with you? I'm going to create a system

1636
02:07:16,802 --> 02:07:21,063
in which rebellion will be combined with order, nonbeing with being.

1637
02:07:21,063 --> 02:07:25,324
I will transcend all contradictions.

1638
02:07:25,324 --> 02:07:29,585
It would perhaps be better if you'd just leave the room. You've disappointed me.

1639
02:07:29,585 --> 02:07:33,846
It's all over between us. I'll probably return to writing my memoirs.

1640
02:07:33,846 --> 02:07:38,107
Let me just ask you this: if nothing exists and if even rebellion is impossible,

1641
02:07:38,107 --> 02:07:42,369
then what can be raised up out of this nothingness and made to exist?

1642
02:07:42,369 --> 02:07:46,630
It's late. We could all do with a bite to eat

1643
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:50,891
Isn't anybody going to answer me?

1644
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:55,152
Eleanor, what are we having for lunch today? I'd like something light.

1645
02:07:55,152 --> 02:07:59,413
My stomach's a bit queasy.

1646
02:07:59,413 --> 02:08:03,674
It's high time we took better care of it.

1647
02:08:03,674 --> 02:08:07,935
You're right, Stomil. From now on we'll look after you.

1648
02:08:07,935 --> 02:08:12,196
You're right, we need to move to a regular life.

1649
02:08:12,196 --> 02:08:16,457
What? Silence?

1650
02:08:16,457 --> 02:08:20,718
From now on we will take care of our body.

1651
02:08:20,718 --> 02:08:24,979
A little nap after lunch, a little stroll after napping.The morning will be for experiments.

1652
02:08:24,979 --> 02:08:29,240
Silence?

1653
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:33,502
And everything cooked in butter, or maybe cut out fats entirely.

1654
02:08:33,502 --> 02:08:37,763
Of course, a light diet. So it doesn't ruin our sleep.

1655
02:08:37,763 --> 02:08:42,024
All right, I'll tell you.

1656
02:08:42,024 --> 02:08:46,285
Careful of the dishes, Arthur.

1657
02:08:46,285 --> 02:08:50,546
The only possible answer is power.

1658
02:08:50,546 --> 02:08:54,807
Power? What power? We're your family, remember?

1659
02:08:54,807 --> 02:08:59,068
He's raving. Don't pay any attention to him.

1660
02:08:59,068 --> 02:09:03,329
Power alone can be created from nothing. Power alone can exist in a vacuum.

1661
02:09:03,329 --> 02:09:07,590
Now I am up here above you, and you are beneath me.

1662
02:09:07,590 --> 02:09:11,851
Brilliant, isn't he?

1663
02:09:11,851 --> 02:09:16,112
Arthur, come down !

1664
02:09:16,112 --> 02:09:20,373
You grovel beneath me in dust and ashes.

1665
02:09:20,373 --> 02:09:24,634
How long are we going to put up with this?

1666
02:09:24,634 --> 02:09:28,896
Let him talk. We'll take care of him after lunch.

1667
02:09:28,896 --> 02:09:33,157
It's beyond me where he gets these tendencies. Must be his upbringing.

1668
02:09:33,157 --> 02:09:37,418
Good education!

1669
02:09:37,418 --> 02:09:41,679
Everything depends on being strong and decisive.

1670
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:45,940
I am strong.

1671
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:50,201
Look at me then. I am the answer to your dreams.

1672
02:09:50,201 --> 02:09:54,462
Sir, there will be order.

1673
02:09:54,462 --> 02:09:58,723
Father, you have always rebelled, but your rebellion consume

1674
02:09:58,723 --> 02:10:02,984
itself in chaos. Now look at me !

1675
02:10:07,245 --> 02:10:11,506
Power, too, is rebellion. A revolution in form and order,

1676
02:10:11,506 --> 02:10:15,767
the revolt of the top against the bottom, the high against the low.

1677
02:10:15,767 --> 02:10:20,028
Neither synthesis nor analysis, I am the act, the will and the way,

1678
02:10:20,028 --> 02:10:24,290
I am power. I am above, within and beside all things.

1679
02:10:24,290 --> 02:10:28,551
Give thanks to me for fulfilling the dreams of your youth.

1680
02:10:28,551 --> 02:10:32,812
Master of the form I choose — and not just one, but a thousand possible forms;

1681
02:10:32,812 --> 02:10:37,073
I can create and destroy as I please, incarnate, disincarnate, amputate!

1682
02:10:37,073 --> 02:10:41,334
I have here within me--everything.

1683
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:45,595
Sad to see a thing like this happen !

1684
02:10:45,595 --> 02:10:49,856
Oh don't take it so seriously. Adolescent foolishness.

1685
02:10:49,856 --> 02:10:54,117
Words, words, words. What power has he got over us?

1686
02:10:54,117 --> 02:10:58,378
Right! What does all his talk amount to anyway?

1687
02:10:58,378 --> 02:11:02,639
We're united by blood, not by abstractions.

1688
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:06,900
He can't do a thing to us.

1689
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:11,161
What power? It's very simple. I can kill you.

1690
02:11:11,161 --> 02:11:15,423
I absolutely forbid you. There are limits.

1691
02:11:15,423 --> 02:11:19,684
Limits can be transcended. You taught me

1692
02:11:19,684 --> 02:11:23,945
that power over life and death. What greater power can there be?

1693
02:11:23,945 --> 02:11:28,206
A simple but profoundly important discovery!

1694
02:11:28,206 --> 02:11:32,467
Nonsense! I'll live as long as I please. That is, I mean, as long as it pleases.

1695
02:11:32,467 --> 02:11:36,728
I don't know whom, do you, Stomil?

1696
02:11:36,728 --> 02:11:40,989
– Well… Nature? – Exactly. Nature or fate.

1697
02:11:40,989 --> 02:11:45,250
– Me! – Shut up !

1698
02:11:45,250 --> 02:11:49,511
But suppose I become your fate?

1699
02:11:49,511 --> 02:11:53,772
Eleanor, Stomil, what does this mean?

1700
02:11:53,772 --> 02:11:58,033
I won't stand for it. He's your son, after all.

1701
02:11:58,033 --> 02:12:02,294
Look, Arthur. You've frightened your uncle. He's white as a sheet.

1702
02:12:02,294 --> 02:12:06,555
Don't get up, Stomil. I'll get you a pillow.

1703
02:12:06,555 --> 02:12:10,817
Each one of you has a death shut inside you like a nightingale locked in a cage.

1704
02:12:10,817 --> 02:12:15,078
All I have to do is let it out.

1705
02:12:15,078 --> 02:12:19,339
Nightingale, that was beautiful.

1706
02:12:19,339 --> 02:12:23,600
We ve talked long enough.

1707
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:27,861
Our horizons have been expanded, but now it's time for something concrete.

1708
02:12:27,861 --> 02:12:32,122
Enough theory. Let shave something to eat. What do you say, Eleanor?

1709
02:12:32,122 --> 02:12:36,383
I wanted to suggest that some time ago but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

1710
02:12:36,383 --> 02:12:40,644
Enough now, Arthur, come down. Or at least take your shoes off.

1711
02:12:40,644 --> 02:12:44,905
You're right, Uncle, it's time for something concrete.

1712
02:12:44,905 --> 02:12:49,166
Ed die , my somber angel, angel of divine abstraction, are you ready?

1713
02:12:49,166 --> 02:12:53,427
Ready, chief.

1714
02:12:53,427 --> 02:12:57,688
Then ... Finish me!

1715
02:12:57,688 --> 02:13:01,949
What are you going to do?

1716
02:13:01,949 --> 02:13:06,211
First we're going to rub out Uncle Eugene.

1717
02:13:06,211 --> 02:13:10,472
Rub out? Where on earth did you pick that up?

1718
02:13:10,472 --> 02:13:14,733
And now of all times, with my blood pressure skyrocketing!

1719
02:13:14,733 --> 02:13:18,994
Why me?

1720
02:13:18,994 --> 02:13:23,255
So I'm all just theory, am I? Eddie, show him he's mistaken.

1721
02:13:23,255 --> 02:13:27,516
You trash! What do you take me for?

1722
02:13:31,777 --> 02:13:36,038
This isn't a system. It's mob rule.

1723
02:13:36,038 --> 02:13:40,299
Do your duty, Eddie.

1724
02:13:40,299 --> 02:13:44,560
What does this ape want of me? Keep your hands off me!

1725
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:48,821
He's not an ape. He's the right arm of my spirit, my word made flesh.

1726
02:13:48,821 --> 02:13:53,082
Eleanor, I feel awful. Eleanor!

1727
02:13:53,082 --> 02:13:57,344
Look, your father's fainted.

1728
02:13:57,344 --> 02:14:01,605
Madman! Murderer!

1729
02:14:01,605 --> 02:14:05,866
No! A man who has seen the one possibility and doesn't shrink from it.

1730
02:14:05,866 --> 02:14:10,127
I am pure as nature. I am free. Free!

1731
02:14:10,127 --> 02:14:14,388
Arthur!

1732
02:14:14,388 --> 02:14:18,649
Wait. First we've got to save the world.

1733
02:14:18,649 --> 02:14:22,910
I've been unfaithful to you. With Eddie.

1734
02:14:27,171 --> 02:14:31,432
What?

1735
02:14:31,432 --> 02:14:35,693
I’ve cheated on you with Eddie. I didn't think you'd mind.

1736
02:14:35,693 --> 02:14:39,954
After all, you only wanted to marry me out of principle.

1737
02:14:39,954 --> 02:14:44,215
– When? – This morning.

1738
02:14:44,215 --> 02:14:48,476
I didn't think you'd care. I thought…

1739
02:14:48,476 --> 02:14:52,738
Look I’m ready for the wedding. How do I look?

1740
02:14:52,738 --> 02:14:56,999
Wait a second, wait… You? You did that to me?

1741
02:14:56,999 --> 02:15:01,260
I forgot to tell you You were busy ... We can go now?

1742
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:05,521
Should I wear my gloves? They’re a bit tight. You like the way I've done my hair?

1743
02:15:05,521 --> 02:15:09,782
You did that to me?

1744
02:15:09,782 --> 02:15:14,043
Ah, that's what this is all about. I wouldn't have thought you'd be so concerned.

1745
02:15:14,043 --> 02:15:18,304
Let’s change the subject, shall we?

1746
02:15:22,565 --> 02:15:26,826
How could you… how could you ...

1747
02:15:26,826 --> 02:15:31,087
But you said you only needed me to help you with your plan. Don't you remember?

1748
02:15:31,087 --> 02:15:35,348
I didn't misunderstand you, did I?

1749
02:15:35,348 --> 02:15:39,609
When we were talking and you said such clever things, I was impressed.

1750
02:15:39,609 --> 02:15:43,871
Eddie could never have spoken like that.

1751
02:15:48,132 --> 02:15:52,393
Eddie!

1752
02:15:56,654 --> 02:16:00,915
What's got into you, darling? I've told you, I didn't think you'd care.

1753
02:16:00,915 --> 02:16:05,176
Frankly, I'm surprised at you making such a fuss over nothing.

1754
02:16:05,176 --> 02:16:09,437
Now I'm sorry I even told you.

1755
02:16:09,437 --> 02:16:13,698
But why?

1756
02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:17,959
Oh, my stubborn darling! I had my reasons.

1757
02:16:17,959 --> 02:16:22,220
What reasons?

1758
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:26,481
Let's forget about it. You're just getting yourself all worked up.

1759
02:16:26,481 --> 02:16:30,742
Tell me!

1760
02:16:30,742 --> 02:16:35,003
I only wanted to…

1761
02:16:35,003 --> 02:16:39,265
Your reasons…

1762
02:16:39,265 --> 02:16:43,526
Oh, the stupidest, silliest little reasons ...

1763
02:16:43,526 --> 02:16:47,787
Go on!

1764
02:16:47,787 --> 02:16:52,048
I won't tell you. You always get mad.

1765
02:16:52,048 --> 02:16:56,309
Oh God!

1766
02:16:56,309 --> 02:17:00,570
If you want, we'll never say another word about the whole thing. Is it all my fault?

1767
02:17:04,831 --> 02:17:09,092
Why are you all against me? What have I done to you?

1768
02:17:09,092 --> 02:17:13,353
Mother, did you hear that?

1769
02:17:13,353 --> 02:17:17,614
Ala, I warned you.

1770
02:17:17,614 --> 02:17:21,875
Mama, tell her she mustn't do such things.

1771
02:17:21,875 --> 02:17:26,136
Do something, help me, I can't live like this. Tell her…

1772
02:17:26,136 --> 02:17:30,397
How can she treat me like this silly child.

1773
02:17:30,397 --> 02:17:34,659
Get away from me, you fool.

1774
02:17:34,659 --> 02:17:38,920
I wanted to save you. I was so close… And now you've ruined it all.

1775
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:43,181
Ah, the world is evil, evil, evil.

1776
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:47,442
Come to me, Arthur! Oh, my poor boy, I feel so sorry for you.

1777
02:17:51,703 --> 02:17:55,964
Sorry for me? You dare to pity me? I don't need anyone's pity.

1778
02:17:55,964 --> 02:18:00,225
You don't know me yet… but you're going to now.

1779
02:18:00,225 --> 02:18:04,486
You've rejected my idea. You've trampled me under-foot.

1780
02:18:04,486 --> 02:18:08,747
And you besmirched the noblest idea in all history, you goose!

1781
02:18:08,747 --> 02:18:13,008
You can't even begin to imagine who it is vou've lost. And who did you do it with?

1782
02:18:13,008 --> 02:18:17,269
With this half-witted punk, this garbage dumped out by our times !

1783
02:18:17,269 --> 02:18:21,530
I'll go away, but I won t leave you behind in this world.

1784
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:25,792
You don't know what you re living for anyway.

1785
02:18:25,792 --> 02:18:30,053
Where is he, your darling lover?

1786
02:18:30,053 --> 02:18:34,314
Where's that rotten beer belly anyway? I'll fix that early bird's guts! Where ’s the revolver?

1787
02:18:34,314 --> 02:18:38,575
It's impossible to find anything with all this damned order!

1788
02:18:38,575 --> 02:18:42,836
Mama, have you seen the revolver?

1789
02:18:47,097 --> 02:18:51,358
That was hard.

1790
02:18:51,358 --> 02:18:55,619
Arthur!

1791
02:18:55,619 --> 02:18:59,880
Arthur, my boy…

1792
02:19:04,141 --> 02:19:08,402
Strange… everything's disappeared…

1793
02:19:08,402 --> 02:19:12,663
But I didn't want… It's not true!

1794
02:19:12,663 --> 02:19:16,924
I loved you, Ala. ..

1795
02:19:16,924 --> 02:19:21,186
Why didn't you tell me before?

1796
02:19:21,186 --> 02:19:25,447
"I love you and you're sound asleep."

1797
02:19:25,447 --> 02:19:29,708
Wake up , Stomil . Your son is dying!

1798
02:19:29,708 --> 02:19:33,969
He’s dead.

1799
02:19:38,230 --> 02:19:42,491
Perhaps he's better off. He nearly murdered his uncle.

1800
02:19:42,491 --> 02:19:46,752
Forgive him. He wasn't happy.

1801
02:19:46,752 --> 02:19:51,013
Oh, I don't bear him any grudge. He can't hurt me now.

1802
02:19:51,013 --> 02:19:55,274
He wanted to overcome carelessness and neglect.

1803
02:19:55,274 --> 02:19:59,535
He lived rationally, but too passionately.

1804
02:19:59,535 --> 02:20:03,796
He died because his thought had betrayed his feelings.

1805
02:20:03,796 --> 02:20:08,057
He meant well, but he was too highstrung. His kind never gets old.

1806
02:20:08,057 --> 02:20:12,318
Hold your tongue, you scoundrel, and get out of my house.

1807
02:20:12,318 --> 02:20:16,580
You ought to be glad to get off so easy.

1808
02:20:16,580 --> 02:20:20,841
Why should I leave? I'll say it again: Arthur meant well. I'm staying.

1809
02:20:20,841 --> 02:20:25,102
Why?

1810
02:20:25,102 --> 02:20:29,363
It's my turn now. Now you're all going to listen to me.

1811
02:20:29,363 --> 02:20:33,624
We listen? To you?

1812
02:20:33,624 --> 02:20:37,885
Sure why not? You've seen that I pack a wicked punch.

1813
02:20:42,146 --> 02:20:46,407
Nothing to worry about so long as you keep quiet

1814
02:20:46,407 --> 02:20:50,668
and do what I say. You'll see. You won't have to worry.

1815
02:20:50,668 --> 02:20:54,929
I'm an open, easygoing man. I like a joke, like a good time.

1816
02:20:54,929 --> 02:20:59,190
But listen to me.

1817
02:20:59,190 --> 02:21:03,451
We're in for it now.

1818
02:21:03,451 --> 02:21:07,713
You know, Eugene, you talk too much.

1819
02:21:07,713 --> 02:21:11,974
Take my shoes off for me will you?

1820
02:21:16,235 --> 02:21:20,496
I submit to brute force. But I'll despise him in my heart.

1821
02:21:20,496 --> 02:21:24,757
Go ahead and despise me, but now take my shoes off, and quick.

1822
02:21:29,018 --> 02:21:33,279
I've always thought we were slaves of abstractions, but that someday

1823
02:21:33,279 --> 02:21:37,540
humanity would take its revenge. Now I see that it's only Eddie.

1824
02:21:37,540 --> 02:21:41,801
Maybe it won't be so bad. He certainly won't mind if you diet.

1825
02:21:41,801 --> 02:21:46,062
Should I shine them?

1826
02:21:46,062 --> 02:21:50,323
It’s yours. I'm changing anyway.

1827
02:21:54,584 --> 02:21:58,845
A little tight , but not bad .

1828
02:22:03,107 --> 02:22:07,368
Come, Eleanor. We're only a poor old couple now.

1829
02:22:07,368 --> 02:22:11,629
Don't go too far, and be ready to come running when I call.

1830
02:22:11,629 --> 02:22:15,890
Are you coming with us, Ala?

1831
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:20,151
I'm coming. He loved me, nobody can take that away from me.

1832
02:22:20,151 --> 02:22:24,412
We may as well assume it was love.

1833
02:22:24,412 --> 02:22:28,673
Did you say something, Father?

1834
02:22:28,673 --> 02:22:32,934
Me? No.

1835
02:22:37,195 --> 02:22:41,456
I've got the feeling, Arthur, my boy, that nobody needs you anymore.

1836
02:22:41,456 --> 02:22:45,717
Well, Uncle Eugene, would you like to dance?

1837
02:22:45,717 --> 02:22:49,978
Me? With you? Oh, all right, why not?
