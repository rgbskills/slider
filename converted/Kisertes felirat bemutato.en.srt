1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ma rgaret !

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ma rgaret ...

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, Doctor ?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
– Oh, Ma rgaret , would you make me a cup of coffee? – Yes, of course.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And one for me, please.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And me...

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
– That's three coffees, then? – Right.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
– Hi ! – Hi, Henry.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi there...

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
– Have they been yet? – Not yet.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
– Where's Vilma? – Oh, she's slipped out to get some oranges.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thanks very much.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
– Ma rgaret ... – Yes, Doctor?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sorry about this, but would you mind making another cup of coffee for me?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
– Of course not. – Thanks.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
– Well? – Well what?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
– How goes it? – What, exactly?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
– Why, your private studies, of course. – I don't know what you're talking about.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, come off it, Henry — every little child here knows about it !

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't give a damn what little children know about — I am engaged in no other studies

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
than those pertaining directly to my work here at the Institute.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I know what it is — you don't trust us, do you?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can't say I blame you... in certain matters caution is called for.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Especially if one is engaged on two fronts at once...

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And what's that supposed to mean?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're all letting your imaginations run away with you. ..

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What about that social tonight - is it still on?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Naturally...

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Good morning, sir.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Good morning, friends !

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sit down, sit down, please, you know that neither I nor the Director like to stand on ceremony .. .

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So what's the news? Did you all sleep well?

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Any problems? I don't see Vilma here.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She phoned to say her bus had broken down.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But she had managed to find a taxi, she said, so she should be here any minute...

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Looking forward to the social, are we? I hope you're all coming?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm coming, definitely...

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We're all coming .. .

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Excellent! Personally, I consider our social evenings to be a splendid idea.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Particularly as regards their collectively therapeutic effect.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Simply thanks to the way we, as individuals, invariably loosen up, while, as a collective,

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we somehow grow stronger. Wouldn't you say?

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, quite, that's exactly how I see it.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Quite apart from the fact that it would be criminal not to make

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
at least occasional use of such a fine garden !

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I came a little earlier on purpose.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is something wrong?

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The Director will tell you himself. All I wanted was to ask you to be sensible —

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
do try to understand him and don't make unnecessary problems for him,

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
he is in a difficult enough position as it is. I think we can be glad we have such a Director,

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we're really doing ourselves a favour. It is therefore up to us to display

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
at least a minimum of self-discipline so that neither he, our Institute,

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
nor any one of us should get into hot water.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sure you understand and won't expect me to say more than I've already said and am able to say.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We're all adults, after all, are - we not?

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, of course.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There you are, then ! Have you had your soap ration?

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
– They're due to bring it today. – Excellent!

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Good morning, Director.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hello there, friends. Do sit down, please, you know that I don't like to stand on ceremony.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's just what I told our colleagues just now, Director !

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
– Did you sleep well? – Yes, thank you.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
– Do you have any problems? – No, I don't think so .

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where is Vilma?

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She phoned to say her bus had broken down. But she had managed to find a taxi,

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
she said, so she should be here any minute.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
– Here it is. – Thanks.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Looking forward to the social, are we?

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Very much, Director.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have good news for you, friends. The Director has promised to make a short appearance at our social.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A short one?

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That'll depend on the circumstances. I hope you'll show up?

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, of course, Director.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Look here, colleagues, no sense in making a meal of it.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We all have work to do. So let me get straight to the point: as you probably know,

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
there have lately cropped up complaints that our Institute isn't fulfilling its tasks

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
in keeping with the present situation...

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What situation?

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But my dear colleague, Neuwirth, let's not beat about the bush.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Are we not the people who're supposed to be the first to know things,

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and the first to take action? That’s why they’re paying us.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But to continue: w e're being urged, with increasing insistence, that we go over to the offensive.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Firmly in the spirit of the scientific…

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That, surely, goes without saying?

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry, Director, but unfortunately there exists science that is not based on a scientific view of the world...

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That is no science where I'm concerned! Now, where was I?

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You were saying that we must somehow try and implement...

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In order to counter the isolated but nevertheless alarming expressions

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
of various irrational viewpoints which can be discerned in particular in certain members

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
of our younger generation and which owe their origin to the incorrect...

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Now, where was I?

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You were saying that the irrational…

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
…interpretation of the complexity of natural processes and the historical dynamism

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
of human civilisation, some of whose aspects are taken out of context,

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
only to be interpreted, either in the light of pseudoscientific theories...

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We have discovered that copies of some of the works of C.J. Jung are circulating among our young people...

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
... Or in the light of a whole range of mystic prejudices, superstitions, obscure teachings

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and practices spread by certain charlatans, psychopaths and members of the intelligentsia...

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sorry to be late, Director, but just imagine — the bus I was on...

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
– Yes, I've heard. Sit down. – Thank you.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Look here, colleagues, no sense in making a meal of it. We all have work to do.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have already acquainted you with the size of the problem and the tasks it puts in front of us.

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now it is up to you. All I want to do is to ask you to be sensible,

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
try and understand and don't make unnecessary problems for me in what is a difficult enough position as it is.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It’s  good cause, after all! We live in modern times, after all.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
W e do.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There you are, then ! Have you had your soap ration?

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They're due to bring it today .. .

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I rely on you, Henry...

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
– You mean, where the soap is concerned? – The soap and everything else.

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
– Who is it? – It's only me, Doctor.

113
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Just a moment !

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come in, Mrs Houbova.

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh dear, the place is full of smoke! You need a bit of air.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, right, in a minute. .. a nything wrong?

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You have a visitor.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
– Have I? Who is it? – I don't know, he didn't tell me.

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
A stranger, is it?

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He’s never been here. Never seen him before.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What does he look like?

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I dunno — how should I say, a bit disreputable... and, worst of all, he…

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
– He…? – I hardly like to say...

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
– Go on, out with it, Mrs Houbova! – Well, it's just that he… smells...

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is that so? How does he smell?

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hard to say — like a strong cheese, I guess.

127
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Never mind, tell him to come in .. .

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're to go in…

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
– Good afternoon. – How do you do, Mr. Foustka.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very cosy, very cosy indeed. Just as I imagined it.

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All these learned books... a rare globe... everything nice and restrained... balance in all its glory. ..

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What balance? And anyway, who am I speaking to?

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All in good time. May I sit down?

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Please do…

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I take it I don't have to stress that you should not mention my visit

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
to anyone in your own interest as well as mine?

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why should I not mention it?

138
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You'll see soon enough.

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
My name is Fistula.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
My place of work is immaterial — in any case I don't have a permanent job.

141
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't have to, you see, being retired as an invalid.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'd hazard a guess that you work in a match factory.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Athlete's foot, my dear sir, or some similar ailment I suffer from, and there's little I can do about it.

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Aren't you going to ask me what it is I want? What is the purpose of my visit?

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, I have not yet given up the hope that you will tell me without being asked.

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Of course, there is nothing to prevent me doing just that, and if I haven't done so already, then for a very good reason.

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What reason is that?

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I had rather hoped you'd discover that for yourself.

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How can I know when I see you for the first time?

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And anyway, I have neither the time nor the inclination to play silly guessing games.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Unlike you, I happen to have a job and will shortly have to go…

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I know, to your Institute's social. You have bags of time.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How did you know I'm going to our social?

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And before I arrived you didn't exactly carry on like a man in a hurry.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't know anything about what I was doing before you arrived.

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Forgive me, but I know far more than you about, what I know

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and what I don't know, and how I know what I know.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
– Look here, Mr... – Fistula...

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm asking you straight, and I expect a straight answer: what is it you want?

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Does the name Marbuel mean anything to you? Or Loradiel? Or Lafiel?

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Out!

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
– I beg your pardon? – I said: o ut!

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How do you mean out?

164
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Leave my flat at once and never show your face here again !

165
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Did you hear what I said?

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I heard what you said...

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
... and I'm delighted at your reaction

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
because it confirms that I have come to the right address...

169
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't understand...

170
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Your agitation tells me that you're well aware of the weight of my contacts,

171
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
which you would hardly be in a position to know unless you had earlier taken

172
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
an interest in them yourself .. .

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Those names mean nothing to me, I have no idea what you're talking about,

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and the suddenness of my decision to throw you out is due simply to the fact that

175
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have suddenly had enough of you.

176
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Leave my flat at once and never show your face here again!

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Your first request — that I leave — I'll naturally comply with, even though not just yet;

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the second I will not, and you will in time be very grateful to me for it.

179
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm afraid you didn't understand. Those weren't two mutually independent requests

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
— in fact, they weren't requests at all. It was a command, single and indivisible.

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Understood. However, I must add: the alacrity with which you subsequently

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
attributed a different motive to that command, all this proves just one thing:

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that your original fear of me as a representative of those contacts has given way to a fear of me

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
as a possible agent provocateur. I therefore have to tell you that this, too, I anticipated.

185
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Nay, what is more, if this had not happened I should have found it suspicious

186
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and would have had to ask myself if indeed you are not an agent provocateur.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But now let's get down to the matter in hand. There is of course no way I can prove to you

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that I am no provocateur; even were I to call forth Ariel himself, here and now,

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
it would not exclude the possibility that I am also trying to provoke you.

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You thus have only three choices: you can continue to consider me

191
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
an agent provocateur and insist that I leave.

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Secondly: not to think of me in those terms but instead to trust me.

193
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Thirdly: not to make your mind up in this matter just yet and to adopt a waiting posture,

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
which means not to throw me out but on the other hand to say nothing which,

195
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
if I were an agent provocateur, I might be able to use against you.

196
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If I may, I'd recommend the third alternative...

197
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
All right. I should add, though, that in talking to you, I have no need to watch

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
what I say because there is no question that I might think, much less utter,

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
anything that could be used against me.

200
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Splendid! I like you. If I were an agent provocateur, I'd have to admit

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that you have passed your first test with flying colours !

202
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Your words betray a wellfounded caution as well as your sharp intelligence and ready wit,

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
all of which are qualities I can but welcome, for they give me hope that I can rely

204
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
on you and that we shall work well together.

205
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
– Now, listen here, Mr... – Fistula...

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Listen here, Mr Fistula, I'd just like to say two things.

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Firstly: To my mind you talk too much and I wish you'd come more quickly

208
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to the point and tell me what brought you here.

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You have given me no indication, even though I asked you for a straight answer to my straight question.

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And secondly: I’m surprised to hear that you and I are supposed to be working together.

211
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It takes two to play, you know.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You have just used eighty words to reply to me.

213
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Considering their semantic value, that is not exactly a small number,

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
so I would not accuse others of talking too much if I were you.

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Loquaciousness is well known to be infectious...

216
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I hope that in time you will also acquire some of my more important skills.

217
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you trying to tell me you want to teach me things?

218
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
– Not just teach... – No? What else, for God's sake?

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Leave him out of this!

220
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What else do you have in mind, then?

221
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
To initiate you...

222
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's enough! I am a scientist and hold a scientific world view,

223
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
working in a very responsible position in one of our foremost scientific institutes !

224
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If anyone comes to me with ideas that can be defined

225
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
as an attempt to spread superstition, I shall be forced to act according to my scientific conscience.

226
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Doctor, I am well acquainted with your views, I know how much your work at the Institute

227
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
means to you, so please accept my apologies for my stupid joke.

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In any case, it's high time I abandoned these introductory pleasantries.

229
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
As your Director was good enough to stress this morning, one of the tasks facing your Institute

230
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
is to combat certain expressions of irrational mysticism.

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
As a scientist, you yourself know best that this struggle of yours will be the more effective,

232
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the more thorough your knowledge of that which you are struggling against.

233
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You have in your possession a remarkable collection of hermetic literature,

234
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but as you well know, theory is not everything, and I'd seriously doubt that you have never felt

235
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
the urge to acquaint yourself directly with contemporary magical practice.

236
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I come to you as a practitioner with several hundred successful magical evocations behind him,

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
who is prepared to acquaint you with some aspects of his work in order to provide

238
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
valuable material for your scientific studies.

239
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And if you are asking yourself how it is possible for a hermetic to take an interest

240
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
in the struggle against hermetism, I can give you a frank answer:

241
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I find myself in a situation where, without some support, I might come to a sticky end.

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I therefore offer myself to you as a subject for study, and I shall ask for nothing more

243
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
in return than that you should, if necessary, testify that I have put myself at the disposal

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
of science and that it would thus be unfair to hold me responsible for spreading

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
something that I am, in actual fact, helping to combat.

246
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
– I have a suggestion... – Yes? I'm listening...

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
In order to expedite matters, I'll pretend not to be equipped with a scientific world view,

248
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
as if I were taking an interest in certain things out of mere curiosity.

249
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Agreed!

250
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ouch!

251
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Man, your temperature must be fifty below!

252
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Not that much…

253
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Well? What is it? Lost your tongue all of a sudden?

254
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
– I'm waiting... – Waiting for what?

255
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
– Your wishes. – I don't understand — what wishes?

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How can I acquaint you with my knowledge unless you set me certain tasks

257
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
such as you can yourself verify? Or those that are important to you for some reason?

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, I see. What kind of tasks do you have in mind — roughly?

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Come, you know enough about these things !

260
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yes, perhaps, but faced with this opportunity of a practical demonstration…

261
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No matter, I'll help you. How about this for an innocent first step.

262
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
As far as I know, you fancy a certain young lady...

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know what you're talking about...

264
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh come, Doctor, after all that has been said here,

265
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
surely you cannot doubt that I might be privy to a secret or two...

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If you mean the secretary at the Institute, I don't deny that she is pretty, but that hardly entitles you...

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What if tonight at that social of yours she were to fall in love with you?

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
– Please go away! – Who? Me? Why?

269
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes, you. Go away.

270
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're not starting that again? Just when I thought we had come to an understanding.

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
– You have insulted me. – Insulted you? How?

272
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not so desperate that I need to turn to magic in matters of love!

273
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Do you think I'm so badly off that I am neither a weakling, incapable of going without

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that which I can't achieve by my own efforts, nor yet a scoundrel who would conduct

275
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
experiments on an unsuspecting innocent girl !

276
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
None of us really knows what we're capable of ! But that's not the point.

277
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If my well-meant, innocent, spur of-the-moment little idea offends you in any way,

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I naturally apologise and withdraw it.

279
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And another thing: I have a girl friend and I am faithful to her.

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
– As she is to you? – What are you saying?

281
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Forget it…

282
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, just a minute — you can't get away with hints and double entendres !

283
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm not interested in gossi p , and I don't like loose tongues !

284
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Sorry I spoke. If you have decided to turn a blind eye, that is entirely your business...

285
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Are you leaving? I just let off a little steam.

286
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
– So what's to become of it? – What's to become of what?

287
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
– Our agreement, I mean. – Well?

288
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
– Is it still on? – That is entirely up to you.

289
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We have to realise that out of the infinite number of possible velocities,

290
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
the expansion of the universe chose precisely the one which gave rise to the universe

291
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
as we know it, that is, with sufficient time and other prerequisites for the formation

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
of solid bodies, so that life could exist on them —

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
or at least on one of them! Isn't that a remarkable coincidence?

294
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yes, quite remarkable !

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes, isn't it ? And if you delve further, you'll discover that you owe your existence

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to such an incredible number of equally incredible coincidences that it exceeds

297
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
all conceivable ratios of probability.

298
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
All this cannot surely be an accident, behind it must be concealed some more profound intention

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
of existence, of the world and of nature.

300
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Does it not strike you as if the cosmos had actually determined to see itself one day

301
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
through our eyes and to put the questions which we are now putting, with our lips?

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh yes, that's exactly how it strikes me !

303
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Having a good time, you two?

304
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
– We have been discussing some philosophical questions... – In that case, don't let me disturb you...

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And another thing: modern biology has long been aware that while the law

306
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
of the survival of the fittest and similar discoveries explain a great deal,

307
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
they fail altogether to explain why life should exist in the first place in the endless variety

308
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
of its frequently quite self-serving manifestations, which would seem to be here

309
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
only because existence wishes to display its own power.

310
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
For whose sake, though? Have you given any thought to this?

311
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Not quite in this way, I must confess. ..

312
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
...b ut now, I guess I'll think about it always; you know how to put it so nicely.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
– May I have the pleasure? – Yes... of course.

314
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
– You'll come back, won't you? – But of course! It's all so terribly interesting...

315
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
A splendid evening, isn't it?

316
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why, yes... we've been lucky with the weather...

317
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
– Do sit down. May I join you? – Yes, please do…

318
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
– Henry... – Yes?

319
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Tell me frankly — what do you think of me?

320
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
What do I think?

321
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Well, how should I say, I think that everyone at the Institute is glad that you are in charge...

322
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
No, you don't understand. What I want to know is what you personally think of me — as a man...

323
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
or, to put it more accurately: what are your feelings towards me?

324
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
– I feel great respect for you... – Is that all?

325
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Well... how to say it… it's very difficult...

326
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So here you are, Director. We've been looking for you...

327
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Anything wrong?

328
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Nothing in particular. It's only that Petruska here wants to ask you something but is too shy to say so…

329
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Ask me what?

330
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
She wants to ask you whether you would dance with her…

331
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm afraid I don't know how to lead, I'd only trample her dress.

332
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
But there are so many better dancers here...

333
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
In that case, would you at least accept our invitation and accompany us to the pond,

334
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
where colleague Kotrly has built a delightful underwater light display.

335
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Have you seen my underwater light display yet?

336
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
– You're doing it all wrong, Vilda. – What am I doing wrong?

337
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You're crawling so abjectly that before long those two idiots

338
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
will get fed up with you and you'll be the laughing-stock of the Institute.

339
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Apart from which, everyone will want to see you come a cropper.

340
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Maybe I am doing it all wrong, but that's still better than pretending

341
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm not interested and at the same time telling 'em everything...

342
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I take it you're referring to Neuwirth?

343
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Who else? Who was it first started blabbing about Foustka's dabbling in magic?

344
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If they get to hear of it, it'll be Neuwirth's doing!

345
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But we all talked about it! You're being unfair to Neuwirth,

346
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
your only excuse being that it is out of jealousy...

347
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I might have known you'd take his side!

348
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
P lease don't start that again!

349
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Liba, give me your word there is nothing between you !

350
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
– I give you my word ! How about another dance? – Okay!

351
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh, well, let me not disturb you...

352
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Go on, talk some more! Each word of yours seems to open my eyes...

353
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I can't understand how I could have been so blind — so superficial...

354
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'll start, if you'll allow me, from a completely different angle.

355
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Have you ever thought that we would be quite unable to understand even

356
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
the most simple moral action which is not motivated by self-interest,

357
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that in fact it would appear to be quite absurd, if we did not admit to ourselves

358
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
that somewhere within it there is concealed the prerequisite of something higher,

359
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
some absolute, omniscient and infinitely just moral authority, through which

360
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and in which all our actions gain a mysterious worth and through which each

361
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and every one of us constantly touches eternity?

362
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes, yes, that's exactly how I've always felt it to be !

363
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Only I was never able to say it, much less put it into such splendid words !

364
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There you are! All the more tragic, then, that modern man has chosen to deny

365
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
everything that is larger than him, to deride the very notion that there might be something

366
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
higher and that could possibly have some higher meaning !

367
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Having set himself up as the highest authority, he then watches in horror where the world is heading.

368
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Isn't it all so clear and simple! So different from the way people usually talk about them...

369
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and you take it all so seriously ! I don't think I'll ever forget this evening.

370
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I feel as if, in your company, I was becoming a new person every minute —

371
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
please don't be annoyed that I'm being so frank, but you seem to emanate a...

372
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't understand how I could have been indifferent to you all this time...

373
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I've never felt anything like this before.

374
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
May I have the pleasure?

375
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

376
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, come on Ma rgaret — we haven't danced together yet.

377
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
– You'll wait here for me, won't you? – Yes, of course.

378
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Alone again, are you?

379
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Can you smell that? Acacia... evening primrose...

380
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm not much of a fragrance expert.

381
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
– Henry. . . – Yes?

382
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
– Would you like to be my deputy? – Me?

383
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I could swing it…

384
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
– But you already have a deputy. – I’m fed up with him!

385
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
– Henry... – Yes?

386
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
How about coming back to my place when this is over?

387
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Or we needn't stay till the end, simply disappear.

388
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I have some home-made cherry brandy and I'd show you my collection of miniatures,

389
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and we could have a good chat, undisturbed.

390
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
If it got late, and you didn't feel like making your way home,

391
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
you could stay the night. What do you say?

392
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Thank you very much, I appreciate your invitation, but you see, I've already promised...

393
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Vilma?

394
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So here you are, Director ! We've been looking for you...

395
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Anything wrong?

396
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Nothing in particular. We just wanted to ask you what you're doing after this is over.

397
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
We should be honoured if you'd accept our invitation for a nightcap.

398
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Of course, you can sleep at our place, should you wish...

399
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
No, I'm sorry, I am very tired. I have to go home...

400
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I've seen a lot, but the sight of an educated man trying to curry favour

401
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
with his cretinous bosses with tricks such as those coloured bulbs in the pond — that really takes the biscuit!

402
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I'd say it's better to curry favour with those coloured bulbs in the porid than to pretend a lack of interest

403
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and at the same time tell 'em everything !

404
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I might have known you'd take his side!

405
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
D on't start that again!

406
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Liba, give me your word there is nothing between you !

407
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
– I give you my word. How about another dance? – Sure.

408
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
D on't let me disturb you.

409
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
When man drives God out of his heart, he makes way for the Devil.

410
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It is well known that the Devil is a master of disguise.

411
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Can one imagine a more ingenious disguise than that offered him by our modern lack of faith?

412
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Doubtless he finds he can work best where people have stopped believing in him.

413
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That is why destruction in today's world can best be carried out under the banner

414
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
of science, and in this way we scientists have become the grotesque standard-bearers of this destruction...

415
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Forgive me for speaking so frankly, Ma rgaret , but I cannot hold it back any longer !

416
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And who else should I confide in but you?

417
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I love you!

418
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No!

419
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Yes, and I'll go on loving you till the day I die !

420
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You unhappy girl! With me you'd be doomed !

421
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Rather doomed with you and in truth, than to live without you and live a lie.

422
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Having a good time?

423
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
– When was he here last? – Who?

424
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, don't ask such stupid questions!

425
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You mean that dancer?

426
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
About a week ago...

427
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And you let him in?

428
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
He just brought me a bunch of violets.

429
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I told him I didn't have time, that I was meeting you...

430
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I asked whether you let him in. ..

431
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I don't remember... maybe he did come in for a while...

432
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So you kissed each other !

433
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I kissed him on the cheek when he gave me those violets. That's all.

434
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Vilma, be so kind as not to treat me like an idiot. A kiss on the cheek!

435
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Once you let him in I'm sure he’d at least want to dance with you.

436
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Henry, please leave ft alone !

437
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Can't you find something more interesting to talk about?

438
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Did he or didn't he?

439
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
All right, if you must know, he did. And that's all I'm going to say.

440
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I refuse to discuss this any longer. As if you didn't know that I love you

441
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and that no dancer can pose a threat to you.

442
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So please no more of this interrogation !

443
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
After all, I don't give you the third degree — even though I have more reason to than you !

444
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
So you refuse to answer? That, of course, speaks for itself.

445
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I have told you again and again that he means nothing to me, I don't go out of my way to see him,

446
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I don't dance with him. What more am I supposed to do, damn it?

447
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
He's always flitting around you, flattering you, wanting to dance with you ,

448
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and you lap it up! If you didn't, you'd have put an end to it long ago.

449
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I don't deny his attentions flatter me !

450
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm touched by his persistence, the way he refuses to give up even though he knows he hasn't got a chance.

451
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Would you be capable of turning up here at night, from devil knows where,

452
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
just to hand me a bunch of violets — at the same time knowing it was hopeless?

453
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
He persists because you deny him in a way that kindles his hope,

454
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
and you resist him in a fashion that fuels his desire. You whore!

455
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You have obviously made up your mind to insult me.

456
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
For how long did you dance with him?

457
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Now that's really enough, Henry , y ou're becoming a bore !

458
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I've known for a long time that you're something of an eccentric,

459
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
but I'd never have guessed you could be so nasty !

460
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
You seem to be in the grip of a pathological jealousy.

461
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And you're being insensitive, tactless, petty minded and vengeful to boot!

462
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
If at least, you had a real reason...

463
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So you intend to go on whoring?

464
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You have no right to speak to me like this! You spent the whole evening dancing

465
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
attendance on that girl, embarrassing everybody in sight,

466
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
while I trotted around like an idiot — and we end up with you making

467
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
a scene on account of some dumb dancer. How ridiculous can you get!

468
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Do you realise how unjust it all is? Do you understand how selfish and cruel you've become?

469
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
First of all: I don't dance attendance on anybody, and I won't have you speak

470
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
about such a pure being as Margaret.

471
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And secondly: we're not now talking about me but about you,

472
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
so kindly don't try to change the subject!

473
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Sometimes it seems to me that there is some monstrous plan behind all this:

474
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
you first of all arouse feelings in me which I had thought long dead,

475
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
and then you weave your treacherous web around my heart

476
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But I'm not going to let myself be stretched on this rack any longer !

477
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm going to do something to myself... or him... or you— or all of us!

478
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
– Your performance gets better every day… – Well, you're pretty good yourself.

479
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
– Henry… – Yes?

480
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
– Don't you get tired of it at times? – Tired of what?

481
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
– Of me making you take part in these games? – It did irritate me at first.

482
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
– And now? – Now it's beginning to scare me...

483
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Scare you? Why is that?

484
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
It seems to me I'm beginning to take it too seriously .. .

485
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Henry! You're not really getting jealous, are you?

486
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
T hat's too crazy!

487
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Not in my wildest dreams would I have thought such a success possible !

488
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I had become reconciled to you showing only feigned jealousy...

489
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Sorry, but I can't share your enthusiasm.

490
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I don't see what it is you're afraid of ...

491
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Of myself !

492
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Go on!

493
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No, don't underestimate it, Vilma. Something is going on inside me —

494
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I feel I'd be capable of doing things that were always alien to me.

495
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
As if something that had lain hidden deep inside me was suddenly floating to the surface.

496
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
For once you feel a little healthy jealousy !

497
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
There's nothing the matter with you, maybe you're a little disconcerted

498
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
by the goings on at the Institute, especially after last night's unfortunate encounter with the Directo r.

499
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
If only it were as simple as that...

500
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You think he'll destroy you?

501
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
He'll certainly try. Question is, does he have the necessary power?

502
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He has as much power as he wants — certainly where we're concerned .. .

503
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
But there are other kinds of power than that which he happens to wield.

504
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
– You're serious, aren't you? – Yes.

505
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Now you are scaring me !

506
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
P romise me you won't dabble in anything of that sort !

507
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What if I don't promise?

508
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I told you that invalid would bring us nothing but misfortune !

509
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
He's got you all muddled !

510
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Don't tell me you would really take him up on his suggestion?

511
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
– Well, why not? – That's dreadful!

512
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
At least you can see I wasn't just letting off steam.

513
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
– Good evening. Is Vilma in? – Why?

514
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I just wanted to give her something...

515
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Vilma, you've got a visitor...

516
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I s that you?

517
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Sorry to bother you so late... We had a performance in the countryside...

518
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and... I just wanted to give you this...

519
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Thank you...

520
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Well, I'll be off again... sorry if I disturbed you...

521
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
– Bye. – Bye .

522
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I love you .. .

523
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Don't tell me we're the first!

524
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Have you noticed that you only arrive on time when I sleep at your place?

525
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You do exaggerate...

526
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Margaret...

527
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Would you make us a coffee? Strong ones, if possible.

528
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yes … of course...

529
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Did you sleep well?

530
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yes, thank you, well... why no, not really... I had so much to think about...

531
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You really managed to turn the poor girl's head last night.

532
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh, she'll get over it.

533
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
– Henry... – Yes, darling?

534
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I can't remember when we made love so beautifully...

535
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
– Oh, you're here already. – Surprised, aren't you?

536
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
– What on earth is that? – Unbridled passion .

537
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Thank you. ..

538
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
– How about us? – Yes, of course, Doctor...

539
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Good morning, Deputy .

540
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Good morning, friends !

541
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I see that today you're all here early , s plendid !

542
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
T hough today of all days I'd hardly have expected it. ..

543
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, I believe we had a most successful evening last night.

544
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You all deserve thanks for that. Of course, special recognition goes

545
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
to Kotrly here for his underwater lighting effects. ..

546
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Oh, that was nothing…

547
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
No point, friends, in beating about the bush...

548
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Anything wrong?

549
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The Director will tell you himself. All I wanted was to ask you to see things

550
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
as they are, and to try and help us as we try to help you.

551
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
There are moments in life when people either show their mettle —

552
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
in which case they have nothing to fear — or they don't measure up.

553
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But you're all educated people, and so I don't have to draw you a picture, do I?

554
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Now, who'll volunteer to clear up the garden?

555
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I will, if you like. I have to remove all those bulbs anyway. ..

556
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Splendid !

557
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Good morning, Director. ..

558
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Good morning, friends. I see that today you're all here early , splendid!

559
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
T hough today of all days I'd hardly have expected it !

560
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
That's just what I told our colleagues just now, Director.

561
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
A nd yet it is particularly important this morning...

562
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
– Did you sleep well? – Yes, thank you.

563
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
– Do you have any problems? – No, I don't think so…

564
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Look here, colleagues, no sense in making a meal of it…

565
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Anything wrong?

566
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
As we all know, our Institute is a kind of lighthouse of true knowledge,

567
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
indeed I might say it is — in its role of a vigilant guardian of the very scientific nature of science —

568
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
something like the avant-garde of progress.

569
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yes, Director, I have already reminded our colleagues of the responsibility this role places on all of us…

570
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But why am I telling you all this : s omething serious has happened.

571
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But why am I telling you all this : s omething serious has happened.

572
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But why am I telling you all this : s omething serious has happened.

573
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Anything wrong?

574
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Please don't interrupt the Director. He's just about to tell us…

575
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Something serious has happened. The virus has lodged where one would least

576
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
have expected it but where, at the same time, it can cause the most damage —

577
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
that is, in the very centre of the antivirus campaign or, to stay with the metaphor —

578
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
in the central store of antibiotics.

579
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Are you telling us, Director, that right here ... s omeone ... that one of us...

580
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Yes, that's exactly what I am telling you, filled as I am with deep sorrow, shame and indignation.

581
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We have here in our midst, in this scientific institute ,

582
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I underline the word scientific — someone who for a long time now and

583
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
of course in complete secrecy, which only goes to show his two-faced character,

584
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
has been engaged in various so-called hermetic practices, seeking in these murky waters

585
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
the hidden treasure of allegedly higher — in other words, pre-scientific learning.

586
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Any questions?

587
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
May we know the name of this colleague?

588
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Tell them !

589
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I can scarcely bring myself to say it, but name him I must.

590
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Very well then — it is Dr Foustka.

591
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
A nyone else wish to speak?

592
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes, I do….

593
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
No , please stay out of this!

594
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
This concerns us all without exception , so let our miss secretary share her opinion as well..

595
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Forgive me, Director, I am no scientist and I don't know how to put it —

596
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but this simply can't be true! Dr Foustka is a wise and honourable man.

597
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
H e worries about things which by rights we all should be worrying about —

598
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
he tries to think things out for himself... to get to the bottom of things...

599
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the sources of morality ... the order of the universe...

600
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
All the rest — all this talk about those contacts... I simply don't believe it.

601
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm sure it's all just gossip, put about by malicious people who wish to harm him.

602
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
When we finish here, please arrange for her immediate dismissal.

603
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes, Director!

604
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Our Institute really cannot now afford the luxury of employing secretaries

605
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
who accuse the management of lying !

606
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You can go and pack your things...

607
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
What possessed you? So needlessly to ruin your life — who'll give you a job after this?

608
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I want to suffer with you!

609
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Excuse me, Director, would it not be more sensible to send her for treatment?

610
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You can see she doesn't know what she is saying.

611
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Psychiatric hospitals are not a cloakroom where one deposits girls whom one first

612
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
confuses with highfalutin ideas and then wants to get rid of.

613
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Are you renouncing me, Henry? And renouncing everything you told me last night?

614
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Be quiet, do you hear?

615
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
If she does something foolish, it'll be your fault !

616
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

617
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
– Don't start... – Who's starting? Me?

618
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Quiet ! I'll enquire upstairs whether she might not be able to take a job as a cleaner with one of the housing administrations.

619
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That would be a sensible and humane solution...

620
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Do you wish to make use of your right to respond to the accusation that has been made against you?

621
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Director, Deputy Director, colleagues. I am confident that my case will be dealt

622
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
with fairly and objectively, and I suppose therefore that when the time comes

623
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I shall be given the opportunity to give a more detailed explanation.

624
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
For the time being, however, I shall confine myself to expressing the hope that

625
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the investigation will be unprejudiced

626
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and have the one and only aim of uncovering the truth.

627
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We are living in modern times and no one here has the slightest intention of staging a witch hunt.

628
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That would only be to revive the old ignorance and fanaticism, against which we are fighting.

629
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Truth must prevail, whoever suffers in the process !

630
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Who has volunteered to tidy up the garden?

631
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I did, Director .. .

632
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I am delighted that you have taken on this task, Vil da .

633
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I shall come and give you a hand. ..

634
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
– What are you doing here? – Waiting for you.

635
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
How did you get in?

636
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
No, not through the chimney, if that's what you fear. I came in through the door,

637
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
which Mrs Houbova kindly opened for me before she went off to do her shopping.

638
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You see, I explained to her that you urgently wanted to speak to me and that,

639
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
given my gammy leg, I could hardly be expected to wait outside.

640
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You mean you lied to her , as usual.

641
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Don't you believe that I'm an invalid?

642
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
That I do. You lied when you pretended that I was anxious to see you.

643
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The truth is, on the contrary, that after everything that's happened, I was hoping to never see you again.

644
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
On the contrary: what has happened makes our meetings that much more desirable !

645
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
How dare you rummage among my papers?

646
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Well, I had to find something to do while I waited...

647
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And what about those shoes?

648
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
D on't be such an old fusspot...

649
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
P retty successful so far, wouldn't you agree?

650
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Successful? What might you be referring to?

651
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'd never have expected you to manage it so quickly and so easily.

652
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You're a good learner, I must say.

653
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I have no idea what you're talking about...

654
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh yes, you have. Did we not agree first of all to carry out a little innocent experiment?

655
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And it succeeded beyond all expectation, don't you think?

656
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
If you mean that that wretched child developed a crush on me, let me just tell you two things .

657
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
F irst : that was no work of magic, much less your doing.

658
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
All that happened was that I had...

659
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Quite by chance...

660
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
…an opportunity to talk to her properly for the first time, and that, as it happens...

661
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
By chance...

662
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
…I was on form that night, so that she found what I had to say interesting.

663
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Well, and as such girls do, her interest soon switched...

664
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
By chance...

665
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
…from the topic of conversation to the speaker.

666
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I can't see anything there that would in any way be out of the ordinary.

667
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And, secondly: seeing what consequences this event had for the girl, I bitterly regret that

668
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
it ever happened, even though I had no idea — how could I?

669
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
that our innocent talk would have such consequences...

670
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
W hat's so funny?

671
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
My dear Doctor! We all know that you don't believe in such unscientific things

672
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
as mere chance and the workings of coincidence.

673
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
You have obviously not asked yourself how it was that you,

674
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
who up till then were just about capable of requesting her to make you a cup of coffee,

675
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
were suddenly waxing so eloquently in front of the girl,

676
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
courageously spouting ideas which you well knew could put your career at the Institute in jeopardy.

677
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Does it not seem odd to you that this should have happened just when we had hatched our little scheme?

678
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And does it not surprise you that your ideas alone —

679
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
as if someone had waved a magic wand — overcame all the girl's inhibitions,

680
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
kindling a love that nothing can destroy?

681
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
W e all have our moments when we somehow manage to transcend ourselves...

682
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That is what I'm talking about!

683
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I don't understand...

684
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You surely didn't think that the spirit of love Je l iel would turn up

685
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
in person at your social and arrange everything for you like some mundane matchmaker?

686
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
How else do you think he could fix it except through you yourself?

687
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It's quite simple, really : he, so to speak, took over your body.

688
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Or rather: he aroused and liberated something in you that's always been there but had lain dormant until then.

689
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You don't say!

690
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The human mind, after all, is not an inert mass —

691
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
you must know that better than I do, being a scientist.

692
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
If the seed is to sprout, someone has first to sow it…

693
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
If — I say if— you and your... whatever-his-name-is...

694
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Your Je l iel are in any way responsible for this unfortunate seeding,

695
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
then I curse the two of you from the bottom of my heart.

696
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You're a devil and I don't want to have anything more to do with you.

697
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Why are you being so dense? If the devil exists, then he is within u s!

698
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
In that case you must be his favourite abode.

699
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
You overestimate me. Can you not understand a simple fact: I am no more than a catalyst,

700
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
helping my fellow-men to bring out something that exists in them without my intervention !

701
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
We only live once, so why should we spend those few decades that are allotted to us

702
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
stifling under the gag of life-denying scruples?

703
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
You know why you called me a devil?

704
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
To rid yourself of responsibility and to ease your conscience by.

705
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I do hope that you will succeed in outwitting your scruples in this way.

706
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
But you must understand that I — an insignificant invalid called Fistula —

707
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
could not budge you by so much as an inch if you did not want to be budged,

708
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
if indeed you had not dreamed about it long ago.

709
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Our little experiment was merely designed to bring these trivialities home to you .. .

710
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
In that case what was all that about its being so innocent?

711
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Nothing but a barefaced lie!

712
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Wrong again! You are once more only trying to lie to yourself !

713
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
You could easily have told the girl how infallible was the scientific view of the world,

714
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
you could have expounded on the worldshattering importance of the work

715
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
your Institute is doing, and she would have been quite safe !

716
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But that's not the point. I really have to compliment you on one thing —

717
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
that, for a beginner, you acquitted yourself really well.

718
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Your disguise in the saintly habit of an impassioned seeker after as the true source

719
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
of the meaning of the universe and of all moral imperatives —

720
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
that was truly magnificent! You chose the very method that is also Je l iel's classic method.

721
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I take my hat off to you !

722
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
What disguise? I was only giving expression to my thoughts !

723
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
– My dear friend... – I am no friend of yours!

724
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
My dear sir, truth is not merely what we are thinking, but also why,

725
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
to whom and under what circumstances we say it.

726
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't know how they managed it, but somehow they've found out that

727
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I have had contact with you, and as a result it is highly likely that I'll be fired,

728
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
made an example of, publicly disgraced, and no doubt existentially and many other ways completely destroyed.

729
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It will be a just punishment for my unforgivable irresponsibility, for my having succumbed

730
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
to temptation, under the influence of a poisonous, unsubstantiated, evil jealousy

731
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
which my overweening pride caused to grow within me.

732
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Thus I tried to kill two birds with one stone, to gain the affections of one and to hurt another.

733
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Yes, I was blinded by some devilish impulse in my heart, and I must therefore

734
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
be grateful to you for helping me realise this.

735
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Your explanation has served to throw light on the true source of my error,

736
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
which as you rightly say has yet again to be sought inside me and nowhere else.

737
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I therefore do not regret our meeting — if that's the word for the way you insinuated yourself into my life.

738
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I have learned an important lesson, and your dark intentions have helped to illuminate my own behaviour.

739
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I am telling you all this because — I firmly hope and believe —

740
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
this is the last time I shall see you. Arid that you will leave this very minute.

741
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I am as well acquainted with the thought processes you have just been kind enough

742
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
to demonstrate for me as I am with these old shoes of mine.

743
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Whenever a beginner successfully breaks the carapace of his or her earlier inhibitions,

744
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
thus giving free passage to all one's latent possibilities,

745
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
there follows the inevitable hangover, accompanied by a bout of what I can only call

746
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
masochistic self-accusation and self-chastisement.

747
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
In short, he turns it into a sort of little dance-floor on which to perform the ritual celebration of his principles.

748
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
All right ! I have had just about as much as I can stand! If you think for a minute

749
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
that by your speechifying you're again going to inveigle me into

750
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
some dubious adventure, you're bloody well mistaken!

751
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
No, my dear sir, it is you who are mistaken if you fondly believe that you're not inveigled already...

752
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Get out!

753
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
May I just point out that when you return to reality and, who knows,

754
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
feel like consulting me, I may not be there to be consulted.

755
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Just go away , please!

756
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Driven by her unreasoning jealousy because he had the audacity

757
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
to spend a few minutes in a philosophical discussion with another woman,

758
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
his mistress shops him to his superiors and tells them

759
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
he has had contacts with a magician...

760
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
What's that? You're a damn liar!

761
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That just goes to show how little you know women.

762
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I just do not believe Vilma would lend herself to something as vile as this.

763
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
After all the sunny moments of pure happiness we've known together!

764
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What do you say, what should I do?

765
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Forget it. ..

766
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Well, what would you suggest I do?

767
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You should have realised by now that I don't go around dispensing advice

768
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
or fixing things. At most I'll occasionally provide someone with a stimulus...

769
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Don't talk in riddles, damn you!

770
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
All you have to do is to summon up, in a good cause, at least a small fraction

771
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
of the cunning which your dear Director makes use of, in pursuance

772
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
of wicked causes, from morning till night !

773
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Who's now going to make us coffee? – Why don't you go and make it?

774
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Why don't you?

775
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
– Hello… – Hi…

776
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
– Have they been yet? – Not yet. ..

777
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
– Poor M argaret ... – What about her?

778
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
– Why, she tried to cut her wrists... – So it is true...

779
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,000
– They say she's in the psycho ward... – The poor thing...

780
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Good morning, sir deputy .

781
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Good morning, friends !

782
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Sit down, please...

783
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
– I don't see Vilma here. – She's had to go to the dentist.

784
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
As you all know, we have a difficult task before us today.

785
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
No one here — as the Director so aptly put it —

786
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
has any intention of carrying out a witchhunt.

787
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Truth must prevail, whoever suffers in the process.

788
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
But all the more reason for us to remember that to seek the truth means to seek

789
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
the whole and unembellished truth.

790
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The truth, my friends, is not just that which is shown to be true,

791
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
but also for which it may be used, who brings it up and for what purpose, i.e. the context. ..

792
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
As scientists we are only too acutely aware that we can completely alter its meaning,

793
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
indeed we can stand it on its head and thus turn truth into a lie and vice versa.

794
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I hope I need not say any more — we're not little children, after all.

795
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
– Or are we? – No, we're not .. .

796
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
There you are, then! Who's feeding the pigeons today?

797
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
– I am... – Splendid.

798
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Hi.

799
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Hello there, friends! Please, prepare the seat.

800
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I can ’t see Vilma.

801
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I asked the same question. I understand she's had to go to the dentist.

802
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
– Did you sleep well? – Very well.

803
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
As you all know, we have a difficult task before us today.

804
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
That's just what I told our colleagues just now, Director !

805
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
We all know what is at stake, so you'll forgive me if I dispense with the preliminaries...

806
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Sorry to be late, Director — I had an appointment with my dentist this morning, and just imagine...

807
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Yes, I've heard. Sit down.

808
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Where was I?

809
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
You were saying that we'll forgive you if you dispense with the preliminaries .

810
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Oh yes. Let us dispense with the preliminaries and come straight to the point.

811
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Dr Foustka...

812
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
... if you would be so kind...

813
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
– Good. Shall we begin? – By all means.

814
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Well then, dear colleague , can you tell us whether it is true that for some time now...

815
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Now, where was I?

816
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You were asking him if it is true that for some time...

817
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Ah yes. Well then, dear colleague , can you tell us whether it is true that

818
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,000
for some time now you have been engaged in the study of what is known as hermetic literature?

819
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
T hat's quite true.

820
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
– How long, would you say? – Oh, I can't say exactly.

821
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Approximately, then: six months, a year?

822
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Something like that .. .

823
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
How many such books would you say you'd read in that time?

824
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I didn't count them.

825
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Approximately: f ive? t hirty? f ifty?

826
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Maybe fifty...

827
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
– Whom did you lend them to? – To no one.

828
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Come, come Dr Foustka, are you trying to tell us that nobody borrowed

829
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
these sought-after, rare and today practically unobtainable books?

830
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Your friends must have seen them, surely .. .

831
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I don't invite friends to my place, and I don't lend books as a matter of principle.

832
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
All right. Now I must ask you to listen carefully, this is a most important question I'm going to ask you :

833
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
w hat made you take up this study in the first place?

834
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Why did you start taking such an interest in these things?

835
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I had for some time been disturbed by the increasing interest taken

836
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
by young people in everything that had to do with the so-called supernatural.

837
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
This unsettling feeling gave rise to the decision to write a brochure in which,

838
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
using the example of esotericism — this heterogeneous and tangled conglomerate

839
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
originating from various cultural spheres — I attempt to demonstrate the striking contrast

840
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
between the various idealistic and mystical teachings of the past

841
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
and our current knowledge about the world.

842
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
This led finally to my deciding to write a study in which I would set out to show

843
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
how diametrically opposed are the various idealistic and mystical beliefs of the past

844
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
to our contemporary knowledge of the world.

845
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Sir, that is exactly how we would have expected you to respond to my question.

846
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It does nothing, however, to explain the shocking fact that you yourself allegedly practised magic...

847
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Well, hardly. I let it be known that I was practising it but did very little practising in actual fact...

848
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Why?

849
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
It was the only way I could gain the confidence of someone

850
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
as distrustful as are today's magicians. ..

851
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I see. Are you saying you desired to be taken into their confidence?

852
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That is interesting, most interesting !

853
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And to what extent, would you say, did you succeed?

854
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
To the modest extent, for the time being, of attracting the attention of a certain individual

855
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
who has now visited me twice, as you have no doubt been informed.

856
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Did that individual tell you why he visited you?

857
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
He said he knew that I was interested in magical practices and that he was willing to initiate me in them.

858
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
And you accepted?

859
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
No, not in so many words — on the other hand I didn't explicitly turn him down.

860
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
What is he asking in return?

861
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
That I should, if need be, confirm that he has put himself at the disposal of science...

862
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Did you hear that, Director! Very clever, I must say...

863
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I think the time has come , dear colleague, to pose our crucial question:

864
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
how do you explain that, on the one hand, you claim to have a scientific view of the world ,

865
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
therefore know that anyone pretending to be a magician is a charlatan,

866
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and yet, on the other, here you are trying to gain the confidence of magicians

867
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
and when one of them actually seeks you out, you not only don't scorn him

868
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and throw him out, you actually intend to collaborate with him.

869
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Indeed perhaps even shield him?

870
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
This may seem naive to you, but I simply felt, right from the outset,

871
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
that I must not confine my efforts to help those who are being led astray by these charlatans

872
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
and my intention to do something effective about it

873
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
to mere theorising and propaganda.

874
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I simply felt that having taken the first step, it was up to me to continue the journey,

875
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
and that it was my duty as a citizen to place my theoretical knowledge

876
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
at the disposal of the campaign to unmask and bring to book the perpetrators of these activities.

877
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
At the Institute we are all the time professing to be fighting against pseudo-science,

878
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
mysticism and superstition — and yet we would be hard put

879
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
to it to point a finger at even one of those who spread these poisons.

880
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And not just us — it is nothing short of amazing how little is known

881
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
about these matters, how unsuccessful all the attempts to infiltrate these murky waters.

882
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
No wonder then that the disease is spreading so rapidly.

883
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
That is why I decided to gain the confidence of these people, penetrate their circle

884
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
and collect damning evidence at the very source. In short, I've decided

885
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
to be an inconspicuous, lone soldier in this — how shall I put it?

886
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
in this secret war, having come to the conclusion that my expertise

887
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
makes me particularly suitable for this task...

888
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
You mean to say that you... that... well, I…

889
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Well, I cannot deny that it would be a bring off some such successful coup.

890
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Dr Foustka is doubtless right when he says that

891
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
no propaganda brochures ever won a war...

892
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Am I to understand then that you would be willing to provide us with a record

893
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,000
of any and every meeting you might have, either with this individual of yours or with anyone else?

894
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
But of course — that's why I've got into this in the first place...

895
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Tell me one thing, though — why is it that this commendable initiative

896
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
of yours has only come to our notice now?

897
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Why did you not inform us about your intentions?

898
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
T hat was a mistake.

899
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
As you know, we scientists tend to work on our own, we are not in the habit

900
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
of reporting every step, and I thought it would be time enough to report progress

901
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
when I had actually achieved something worthy of reporting.

902
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It just did not occur to me that a tit-bit of information from an uninformed source

903
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
could possibly shake the confidence I had in her to enjoyed at the Institute.

904
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
That is hardly surprising, wouldn't you say?

905
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
However noble your idea, what you have done is so out of the ordinary and,

906
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
if I may say so, so unexpected in your particular case that we cannot be blamed

907
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
if at first we misunderstood your motives.

908
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
That is hardly surprising, wouldn't you say? How cunning they are!

909
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
But never mind — let us not waste any more time.

910
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You have convinced me that it was just a misunderstanding, and all that remains

911
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
to be said is that I am glad that it has now been satisfactorily cleared up.

912
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Needless to say, I appreciate what you are trying to do and I shall see to it

913
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
that your remarkable initiative is suitably rewarded — particularly once you get into the habit

914
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
of keeping a record of your researches and regularly passing it on tous.

915
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Any questions, anyone?

916
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Nothing? In that case, let me spring my little surprise:

917
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
tomorrow's social in the Institute garden will be in fancy dress!

918
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Fabulous!

919
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
– What a marvellous idea! – Isn't it. I quite agree...

920
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
What theme will it have?

921
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Obviously — Witches' Sabbath!

922
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
A congregation of devils, witches, magicians and sorcerers. We'll do it in style !

923
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Originally I had thought of it simply' as an attempt to enliven

924
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
our tradition of Institute socials by the addition of a parodic element.

925
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Now, however, I see that, thanks to the coincidence of Dr Foustka's revelations,

926
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
there is also another way of looking at it:

927
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
as a light-hearted tribute to his admirable efforts.

928
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But never mind. Perhaps we can consider this to be a bit of light relief

929
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
after our serious session, which has been so satisfactorily concluded !

930
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That's what good friends are for

931
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
To bring back the long lost dreams And return them to you on a beautiful day

932
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
That's what good friends are fo r

933
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
To recall the joy that slipped away And warm your heart on a cold night

934
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That's what good friends are fo r

935
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
To recall the joy that slipped away And warm your heart on a cold night

936
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Vil d a! Whose turn is it to feed the pigeons?

937
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
– Mine ! – Splendid!

938
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Once you let him in I'm sure he'd expect a little more than a kiss on the cheek!

939
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
At the very least he'd want to dance with you.

940
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Henry, please leave it alone. After all, I don't give you the third degree —

941
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
even though I have more reason than you.

942
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
No, no no…. Put it down there!

943
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
– What is it? – Somehow I don't feel like it today.

944
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
– Does it excite you too much? – No, it's not that.

945
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
– So what's wrong? – As if you didn't know.

946
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But I don't!

947
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
You don't, do you? And who was it who ratted on me,

948
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
telling the Director that the magician had come to see me?

949
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
For heaven's sake, Henry, you don't really think...

950
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
No one else at the Institute knew about it !

951
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Are you crazy? Why should I do a thing like that?

952
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Quite apart from insulting me by believing for a moment that I would be

953
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
capable of denouncing anybody to that idiot, how can you think that I would inform on you?

954
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I would as soon go and inform on myself!

955
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What possible reason would I suddenly have to try and destroy you?

956
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
And with you, to destroy myself — our relationship — our life together —

957
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
our make-believe jealousy — our love, which you have recently confirmed so deliciously by exhibiting real jealousy —

958
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
our memories of all the sunny moments of pure happiness we have known together...

959
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Why, it would be sheer madness!

960
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
What do I know about women?

961
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Perhaps you wanted to take revenge on me because of Ma rgaret —

962
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
or you were simply scared of that invalid and thought that in this way you could

963
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
extricate me from what you considered his clutches...

964
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Come on now, Vilma... I didn't mean it…

965
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It was just a joke...

966
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I thought I'd add a new twist to our game...

967
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Don't touch me! Go away!

968
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Really, Vilma , w hy're you making such a fuss?

969
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
You've often asked me to say far worse things to you...

970
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
That was different. Do you realise what you've done?

971
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
You've accused me in so many words of spying on you!

972
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Kindly get dressed and go away

973
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
and don't ever try to patch up what you've just so brutally destroyed !

974
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Are you serious?

975
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Let's end it here and now. It would have come to that sooner or later...

976
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You mean on account of that dancer?

977
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
No...

978
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
– Why then? – I've lost my respect for you. ..

979
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Well, that's a new one on me.

980
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Today, if you must know, at the Institute —

981
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
it struck me then, when I saw how shamelessly you got yourself out of a h ole.

982
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
In front of everybody, to offer the Director that you'd act as a stool-pigeon for him ?

983
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And now, to top it all, you come and accuse me of acting like one!

984
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Can't you see how absurd it all is? What's got into you?

985
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Can this really be you I'm talking to? Or has some devil truly possessed you?

986
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
That wretched fellow has addled your brain, I expect.

987
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Heaven knows what he did to you, what kind of magic he's trying out on you.

988
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
No magic tricks, he is merely helping me to know myself better and to counter

989
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
the bad things that lie dormant inside me.

990
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Moreover, my acting as a stool-pigeon, as you put it, not only served

991
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
to save me but also to help him — the only way I could !

992
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
If they know that I'm in control, they'll leave him alone.

993
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
And finally, how could I keep my suspicion that you gave me away to myself —

994
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
what kind of a relationship would that be?

995
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
You might have done it inadvertently, perhaps to someone whom you trusted

996
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
or in the hearing of someone whose presence you were unaware of.

997
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I said nothing to nobody, inadvertently or otherwise, and it's not your expressing

998
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
your suspicion that I object to — even though you did it so brutally

999
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
and are now, belatedly, trying to wriggle out of it —

1000
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
what I mind is that you could even think such a thing.

1001
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
If you can do that, even for a minute, then I don't see how we can stay together.

1002
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What an idiot I was to say anything.

1003
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
But then, I always manage to mess things up .

1004
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
What am I going to do without you? What's the use of living, if I'm to lose you?

1005
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I would like to sink into the ground in shame...

1006
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Now you're going to be sorry for yourself, are you?

1007
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Do you remember what we said to each other that day by the river under the elms?

1008
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It'll do you no good to remind me.

1009
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You've hurt me too much for you to talk your way out of it by dragging in our memories.

1010
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
And anyway, I asked you something…

1011
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
– You mean to g o? – Exactly!

1012
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I know what it is — you're expecting the dancer, aren't you?

1013
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I'm not expecting anybody — I just want to be alone !

1014
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
You're lying, you whore!

1015
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Help!

1016
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Sorry to show up so late. I only wanted to give you...

1017
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Thanks. Do come in, and stay a while .

1018
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
He's not well... You know, I'm afraid that...

1019
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
– Is it his heart? – Probably.

1020
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Why don't we dance a little?

1021
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
What do you say? Maybe it will cheer him up.

1022
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
– Who is it? – It's only me, Doctor.

1023
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Come in, Mrs Houbova !

1024
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
What a mess! It needs to be aired out. You have a visitor.

1025
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Have I? Who is it?

1026
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You know, the one who...

1027
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
– Smells? – That's him.

1028
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Tell him to come in. Well, what is it?

1029
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
– I don't know how... – What is the matter?

1030
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Look h ere, Doctor, I'm just an ignorant woman...

1031
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
... I know it's not my place to give you advice...

1032
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
W hat is it you want to tell me?

1033
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I know it's none of my business, but if I were you, I wouldn't trust him !

1034
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
I can't explain... and I don't know why he comes here in the first place,

1035
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
but he… ... well, he gives me the creeps...

1036
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
You let him in readily enough last time.

1037
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Be cause I was afraid of him.

1038
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Well, I know he looks somewhat odd, but he is quite harmless, you know ,

1039
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
o r, more precisely, he's too insignificant to be in a position to do too much damage !

1040
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I don't know why you have to hobnob with such as h im. A gentleman like you ?!

1041
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Mrs Houbovs, I'm over eighteen and perfectly capable of looking after myself.

1042
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I'm afraid for your sake. And is it surprising —

1043
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,000
why, I remember you as a little three-year-old, me not having children of my own...

1044
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yes, yes, I know. Thank you for your concern —

1045
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
you must not think I don't appreciate it, but in this case you really need have no fear.

1046
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Just let him in and stop worrying.

1047
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
You're to go in .

1048
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
– Well? – Well, what?

1049
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I'm waiting for you to start your usual litany.

1050
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
– What're you talking about? – Telling me to get out and so on…

1051
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Now, listen. Firstly, I've realized that there's no way I can be rid of you,

1052
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,000
and that therefore it's a waste of time and effort to try.

1053
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Secondly, without in any way overestimating your so-called stimulating influence,

1054
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I have come to the conclusion that the time spent with you does not have to be entirely wasted.

1055
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
If I have to serve you for your purposes, there is no reason why you

1056
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
should not reciprocate by serving mine in return.

1057
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Did you not at the outset offer to initiate me into your mysteries if I agreed to shield you?

1058
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Well, I accept your offer.

1059
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Yes, I knew you would in the end …

1060
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
which explains why I was so persistent.

1061
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
How nice to see my persistence rewarded at last.

1062
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
But let me not overdo the modesty — I don't ascribe your decision to my persistence alone,

1063
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
but also to the undoubted success of our collaboration...

1064
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
What success do you have in mind?

1065
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Well, not only have you managed to keep your job at the Institute,

1066
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
you have actually strengthened your position there.

1067
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
If by that you mean that I've jettisoned all my moral principles and left myself open

1068
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
to whatever you may choose to awaken in me, then you are very much mistaken.

1069
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I have not changed, I have only gained a little more self-control.

1070
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
– What's so funny? – May I be absolutely frank?

1071
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
– Be my guest. – You are!

1072
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You're laughing at me, is that it? Of all the bloody cheek!

1073
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Look here, Doctor. There's nothing wrong with you saving your skin by dint of a little skulduggery —

1074
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
after all, that's precisely the procedure that Haajah and I…

1075
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Who?

1076
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Haajah, the spirit of politics. We prompted you to act as you did.

1077
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
But you shouldn't have forgotten the rules of the game.

1078
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Rules? What game? What the devil are you talking about?

1079
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Does it not occur to you that, like everything else, our collaboration also has its rules?

1080
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Do away with your scruples as much as you like —

1081
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
you know that I'm all in favour of that.

1082
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
But you really shouldn't try and cheat the one who is guiding you on this exciting,

1083
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I might perhaps say revolutionary, path. Revolution, too, has its rules.

1084
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Last time you called me a devil. Just imagine for a moment that I really am one !

1085
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
How do you think I'd react to your amateurish attempt to fool me?

1086
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Fool you? But I wasn't...

1087
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Look, even if we didn't explicitly promise, surely it should have been obvious

1088
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,000
that we would not mention our collaboration to anyone,

1089
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
much less write official reports about it for those in authority who take a negative view of it.

1090
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
You have read enough books on the subject to know that even in my sphere

1091
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
there are limits that cannot be ignored.

1092
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
You should also know that here, where the stakes are so high,

1093
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
the inviolability of these boundaries is even more of a legal requirement;

1094
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
it is not even a law anymore, it is a commandment!

1095
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Surely you must realise that, being able to play with the entire world,

1096
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
we have to put our trust in contacts that simply cannot be trifled with.

1097
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
As for H im, he loads man with a multitude of unrealistic commandments,

1098
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and so he has no alternative but to forgive, from time to time.

1099
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Others, on the contrary, liberate man from all these impossible commandments,

1100
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and as a result of course they do not have the need,

1101
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
the opportunity, and in the last instance the they could scarcely forgive someone

1102
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
who goes back on the agreement that opens up all this boundless freedom.

1103
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Their entire world would collapse, were they to do that !

1104
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The truth of the matter is, that only by undertaking to be faithful to the authority

1105
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
that gives us this freedom can we expect to be freed from all undertakings.

1106
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Do you follow my drift?

1107
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Yes, I understand everything you're saying, but I fear that you fail to understand me.

1108
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You don't say !

1109
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
The undertaking you are obviously referring to can only be considered

1110
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
as an attempt at treachery on my part by someone who is unaware of the reason

1111
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
why I was able to give it with a clear conscience.

1112
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
You did it to save your skin...

1113
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Yes, of course, but what would that have been worth had it been paid for by treachery?

1114
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Do you take me for an idiot?

1115
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I could give that undertaking only because I had made up my mind from the start

1116
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
not only not to keep it, but at the same time to make the best use of the position

1117
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I have gained with its help — naturally in close consultation with you,

1118
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
in the spirit of our agreement and for our benefit.

1119
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
In other words, I am now in a position to know exactly what the other side is up to

1120
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and to flood them with our disinformation;

1121
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I can cover our tracks and provide them with false ones; and I can use all this

1122
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
to help those of us who are in danger

1123
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
and sink those who endanger us.

1124
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I can serve our cause like an agent planted in the very midst of the enemy,

1125
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
indeed, at the head of the very department whose job it is' to wage war against us.

1126
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I am surprised and disappointed that you have failed to grasp and appreciate my intentions.

1127
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Even though you may well have invented this explanation— so be it, I accept it t o give you your last chance .

1128
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We, too, can occasionally forgive and offer the culprit the opportunity to reform.

1129
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
If a little while ago I told you otherwise, then that was only to scare you and coax you

1130
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,000
to make this quite unambiguous offer, thus saving you from the very edge of the precipice.

1131
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
As you can see, I really am not the devil — luckily for you:

1132
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,000
the piece of treachery you have been able to get away with in my case would have cost you dear if I were…

1133
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Man, your temperature must be a hundred below!

1134
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Not quite...

1135
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Do you know if the Director is here yet?

1136
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
No, I don't.

1137
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
– Have you seen Petruska? – She's not been here...

1138
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Where are you thinking of putting it? Somewhere here?

1139
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Seems to me the summer-house would be the best place...

1140
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yes, I think you're right. For safety reasons, if nothing else...

1141
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I'll light it in the gardener's shed and then carry it over.

1142
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It takes a few minutes to get going. ..

1143
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I'll put it in the summer-house and a minute or two later — whoosh!

1144
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
– Oh, Director... – Yes, my dear colleague ?

1145
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
– Have you got a minute? – Sorry, my friend, but not just now.

1146
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
– Having a good time? – As you can see...

1147
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
– Have you seen Petruska? – She's not been here...

1148
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
How do I know the right moment has come?

1149
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Oh, just pick your own time. Or I'll give you a sign...

1150
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
– I have other things on my mind right now... – What is it?

1151
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Can you guarantee that nothing will go wrong?

1152
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
What could go wrong?

1153
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Well, can't something catch fire, or someone might suffocate.

1154
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
No, don't worry.

1155
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
– Oh, Director... – What is it, Doctor?

1156
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm sorry, I know you have a lot of other things on your mind, but this won't take a minute,

1157
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and I’m sure, you’ll be interested in it…

1158
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
No, really, not just now...

1159
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And will he not come again? And will he not come again?

1160
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
He never will come again His beard was as white as snow ...

1161
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
All flaxen was his poll. He is gone, he is gone ...

1162
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And we cast away moan. God ’a mercy on his soul.

1163
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Ma rgaret !

1164
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Where is the handsome Prince of Denmark?

1165
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
What are you doing here? Have you run away?

1166
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Please tell him, if you see him, that it cannot all be happening of its own accord,

1167
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
there has to a more profound will at work,

1168
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
willing our existence, the world, all nature...

1169
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Ma rgaret , don't you recognise me? It's me, Henry...

1170
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Or does it not strike you as if the cosmos had actually determined to see itself one day through our eyes

1171
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
and to put the questions which we are now putting, with our lips?

1172
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Do go back, Ma rgaret , they will help you get better... everything will be all right again... you'll see...

1173
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
How should I your true love know From another one?

1174
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
At the very least, I'm sure he wanted to dance with you...

1175
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Please leave it alone! Can't you find something more interesting to talk about?

1176
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Did he or didn't he?

1177
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,000
All right, if you must know, he did. And that's all I'm going to say.

1178
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
– Oh, Director... – Yes, what is it, dear colleague ?

1179
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
– Ouch! – What's happened, Alois?

1180
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
– It's nothing... – What's wrong with your ear?

1181
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
– Have you hurt it? – Did something bite you?

1182
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
– Oh, Director... – Yes, what is it, dear colleague?

1183
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
– Have you seen Petruska? – No.

1184
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Where have you been, sweetheart?

1185
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Oh, Director...

1186
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Yes, what is it, dear colleague?

1187
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I'm sorry, I know you have a lot of other things on your mind,

1188
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
but on the other hand... I really must... having learned my lesson,

1189
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I want to make sure nothing is neglected... I have made certain discoveries, which I have written down in my report.

1190
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Don't bother...

1191
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
But I thought...

1192
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I'm not interested in what you believed, I'm not interested in your piece of paper, I'm not interested in you.

1193
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
You see, my dear sir, the comedy is over !

1194
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I don't understand , what comedy?

1195
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I'm afraid you have been too clever by half, and you have badly underestimated us,

1196
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
taking us for much greater idiots than we really are .

1197
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
– You still don't understand? – No.

1198
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
All right, then, I'll give it to you straight.

1199
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
We of course knew all along what you thought of us,

1200
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
we knew that you were merely pretending to be loyal

1201
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
while concealing your true views and interests.

1202
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Nevertheless, we decided to give you one last chance and so we pretended

1203
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
to believe your fairy-tale about working for us undercover, so to speak.

1204
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
We were curious to see how you would conduct yourself after the scare we gave you,

1205
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
whether perhaps you might at last see the error of your ways and come to your senses.

1206
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
You chose to spit at our helping hand, and by so doing you have sealed your fate.

1207
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
– That's not true! – You know only too well that it is !

1208
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
C an you prove it?

1209
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
– Shall we oblige? – I'd say yes ... l et's.

1210
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yes, boss?

1211
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
What did he tell you yesterday?

1212
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
He said he would pretend to be working undercover for you, while in fact,

1213
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
in cahoots with those you're fighting against, sabotaging your intelligence service at every step.

1214
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
He said, and I quote, that he would be our — that is, their—agent in the very midst of the enemy...

1215
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:20,000
He's lying!

1216
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
What did you say? Can you repeat that?

1217
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I said he was lying !

1218
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
How dare you? How dare you insinuate that one of my finest external collaborators

1219
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and a personal friend of long standing is a liar. Fistula never lies to us!

1220
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Just what I was about to say, Director. Fistula never lies to us!

1221
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
So Fistula was an agent provocateur you sent to test me !

1222
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I was a fool not to throw him out straightaway. ..

1223
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Vilma, I apologise for my stupid suspicions, thanks to which I have lost you !

1224
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Mrs Houbova, my apologies to you, too — of course you were right all along...

1225
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
– Who's he talking to? – That's his landlady, boss.

1226
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You're not the only one I've had to investigate, you know.

1227
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Everyone comes under my scrutiny, and you'd be surprised how long it sometimes takes

1228
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
as opposed to your trivial case — before I can get to the bottom of things.

1229
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So I fell into your trap, after all, didn't I.

1230
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I'm sorry, Doctor... He still has his title, does he?

1231
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Oh, fuck all that...

1232
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Well, I'm sorry, Doctor, but here you go again — simplifying everything.

1233
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Did I not throughout let you know — by dropping various hints as well as quite explicitly

1234
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
— that you had a range of choices and that you alone could decide your fate?

1235
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
You did not fall into any trap of mine, you came a cropper thanks to your own pride,

1236
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
which led you to believe that you could play both ends against the middle and get away with it.

1237
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Have you forgotten the pains I took to explain to you

1238
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
that man has to respect someone in authority — whoever that someone may be — unless he wants to come to a bad end?

1239
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And that even revolution has its rules? I really cannot see how I could have made things any clearer to you !

1240
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
So my conscience is clear.

1241
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I did what I could. I'm afraid it's your funeral if you failed to understand...

1242
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
As always, Fistula is absolutely right. You simply cannot serve all masters,

1243
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
and at the same time deceive them all. You can't just take and give nothing in return !

1244
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Every one of us has to decide where he stands !

1245
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Just what I was about to say, Director ! Every one of us has to decide where he stands !

1246
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Isn't it paradoxical that now when I have finally lost and my knowledge can serve

1247
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
no purpose, I'm beginning to understand it all !

1248
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Fistula is right: I am a conceited idiot who thought he could use the devil without

1249
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
having to sign his soul away to him. As if the devil could be deceived.

1250
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Daddy!

1251
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Just hold on there !

1252
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I never said that there is such a thing as the devil!

1253
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
That's as maybe — but I'm saying it. And he's right here among us!

1254
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
You mean me, of course?

1255
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
You're just a subordinate little demon !

1256
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I know the way your mind works, Foustka, and I see that, through me,

1257
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
you would like to point an accusing finger at modern science and denounce it

1258
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
as the true source of all evil. Am I right?

1259
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
No, you're not. Through you I merely wish to accuse the destructive pride of intolerant,

1260
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
all-powerful and selfregarding power, which uses science as a handy bow with

1261
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,000
which to shoot down everything that might put it in jeopardy, that is,

1262
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
anything that does not owe its authority to that power.

1263
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Is that the legacy you wish to leave the world, Foustka?

1264
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Yes!

1265
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Somewhat banal, wouldn't you say? Any influencer these days worth his salt

1266
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
scatters such pearls of wisdom by the wayside.

1267
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
However, a legacy is a legacy, so let me demonstrate how tolerant I am

1268
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
— despite what others may think of me — by overlooking my objections and applauding you.
